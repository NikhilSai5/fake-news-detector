The French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote of a dance he saw in 1580 in Augsburg, where the dancers held each other so closely that their faces touched. Kunz Haas (of approximately the same period) wrote, \"Now they are dancing the godless Weller or Spinner.\" \"The vigorous peasant dancer, following an instinctive knowledge of the weight of fall, uses his surplus energy to press all his strength into the proper beat of the bar, thus intensifying his personal enjoyment in dancing.\" Around 1750, the lower classes in the regions of Bavaria, Tyrol, and Styria began dancing a couples dance called Walzer. The L\u00e4ndler, also known as the Schleifer, a country dance in 34 time, was popular in Bohemia, Austria, and Bavaria, and spread from the countryside to the suburbs of the city. While the eighteenth-century upper classes continued to dance the minuets (such as those by Mozart, Haydn and Handel), bored noblemen slipped away to the balls of their servants.",

Due to the automatic message deletion setting, there were also concerns on whether the conversations were kept on official record as mandated by the Presidential Records Act. Waltz responded to the reporting by saying that Goldberg \"really is the bottom scum of journalists \u2026 I don't text him. He wasn't on my phone\", but Goldberg \"somehow gets on somebody's contact and then get sucked into this group\"; Waltz also said of Goldberg: \"I didn't see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else\", raising the possibility that Goldberg \"did it deliberately\". Waltz told the media that \"I take full responsibility. I built the group\", then said: \"We made a mistake. We're moving forward\".",

Both The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post quoted their sources as indicating that Trump did not want to fire Waltz because it would make a left-leaning media outlet (The Atlantic) look good, and that Waltz would have been fired if it was a right-leaning media outlet that exposed him.",

He assessed that Afghanistan could be won through slow cultural conversion by unconventional forces, described as \"multiple generations of winning hearts and minds\", and anticipated 100 years before such objectives could be achieved, saying:We are in a war of ideas and we are fighting an ideology. It is easy to bomb a tank, but incredibly difficult to bomb an idea. We need a long-term strategy that discredits the ideology of Islamic extremism ... We are in a multi-decade war and we are only 15-years in.After telling an anecdote to the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference audience about his time serving in Afghanistan during the public announcement of the Obama-era troop withdrawals, Waltz said of the war in Afghanistan, \"So, are we 15 years in? Yes. Are we in for a lot more fighting, and do we need a long-term strategy to undermine the ideology of Islamic extremism\u2014just like we did fascism and just like we did communism? Yes, we do. Uh, and you know, I think we're in for a long haul, and I think our nation's leadership needs to begin telling the American people, 'I'm sorry, we don't have a choice; we're 15 years into what is going to be a multi-generational war because we're talking about defeating an idea.' It's easy to bomb a tank; very difficult to defeat an idea, and that's exactly what we have to do.\"",
