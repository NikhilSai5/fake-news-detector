James Hecker, commander of the United States Air Forces in Europe \u2013 Air Forces Africa, stated, \"At approximately 7:03 am (CET), one of the Russian Su-27 aircraft struck the propeller of the MQ-9, causing U.S. forces to have to bring the MQ-9 down in international waters. Several times before the collision, the Su-27s dumped fuel on and flew in front of the MQ-9 in a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner. This incident demonstrates a lack of competence in addition to being unsafe and unprofessional.\" Russia says it will attempt to retrieve the drone. The US government claimed that it was prepared for such an outcome. John Kirby, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications, said that \"their ability to exploit useful intelligence will be highly minimised\". While the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley said that there were \"mitigating measures\" to ensure that Russia obtained no access to valuable tech. He also confirmed that the US would look for the drone as well; however, the water in which it crashed was 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200 to 1,500 m) deep. Brigadier General Pat Ryder claimed that drone was \"unflyable and uncontrollable\" and it likely damaged the Su-27 during the collision. The US has since released footage over the Black Sea.",

This was the first time in history a conventional aircraft and a drone had engaged each other in combat. Predators had been armed with AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, and were purportedly being used to \"bait\" Iraqi fighters, then run. However, the Predator's maximum speed is 1,800 mph (2,900 km/h) lower than the MiG-25's, and its service ceiling is nearly 60,000 ft (18,000 m) lower, making the \"run\" segment of any \"bait and run\" mission a difficult task. In this incident, the Predator did not run (or could not run fast enough), but instead fired one of its Stingers. The Stinger's heat-seeker became \"distracted\" by the MiG's missile and missed the MiG. The Predator was hit by the MiG's missile and destroyed. Another two Predators had been shot down earlier by Iraqi SAMs.",
