La Liga also voiced opposition and threatened legal action. Critics accused FIFA of prioritising commercial interests over player health. The introduction of the annual FIFA Intercontinental Cup was similarly criticised. In May 2024, FIFPRO and the World Leagues Forum sent a letter to FIFA demanding rescheduling and reform of the FIFA International Match Calendar and warned of legal or other action if their concerns were ignored. On June 13, 2024, the English Professional Footballers' Association and France's Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionnels filed a legal claim in the Business Court in Brussels to protest the tournament. FIFPRO also warned of potential strike action. On January 30, 2025, a meeting between FIFA and FIFPRO was held to address fixture congestion. In response to the criticism, FIFA stated that the Club World Cup's schedule followed the international calendar and allowed for rest before domestic competitions, adding that its events occupied just 1 percent of the football calendar and were agreed with players and confederations.",

    "text": "Several clubs in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup were linked to multi-club ownership structures, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Among them were Mexican sides Pachuca and León, both owned by Grupo Pachuca. FIFA regulations prohibit any club from owning shares in, being a member of, or exerting influence over another participating club, with \"influence\" defined through control of voting rights or decision-making authority. In November 2024, Costa Rican club Alajuelense requested FIFA to apply this rule and disqualify one of the two Grupo Pachuca clubs, threatening legal action if no action was taken. Alajuelense argued that it was next in line to qualify under CONCACAF's rankings, but FIFA determined the club could not be party to proceedings. On February 4, 2025, Alajuelense appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against FIFA, Pachuca, and León. On March 21, FIFA announced that León had been removed from the tournament. According to The Guardian, a play-off would determine the replacement between Los Angeles FC, runner-up of the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, and América, the highest-ranked Mexican club not already qualified. Alajuelense and Philadelphia Union were not considered. León appealed, and hearings for both its case and Alajuelense's took place in April and May 2025 respectively, but on May 6 FIFA confirmed that León's expulsion would stand and that the play-off would proceed. LAFC secured the final spot with a 2–1 extra time win over América on May 31 at BMO Stadium.",

A 10 percent cancellation fee applied to exchanges also drew attention, but the overall response to the tournament was positive. The opening fixture between Al Ahly and Inter Miami saw strong turnout following final-week promotional campaigns, and FIFA reported over 60,000 spectators in attendance, with strong international broadcast figures. By early July, FIFA had recorded over 2 million tickets sold and average attendance of approximately 36,000 per match, a figure comparable to several leading European domestic leagues. While 14 matches attracted smaller crowds of under 20,000, mostly at MLS venues, 11 fixtures surpassed 90 percent capacity, including six at Hard Rock Stadium. Supporters from South America, Africa and Asia were especially prominent throughout the tournament, although a match involving Wydad AC and Juventus saw minor incidents involving smoke bombs and one arrest.",

    "text": "As with previous editions of the FIFA Club World Cup, the expanded 2025 format allocated a slot for the host nation. This slot had traditionally been filled by the domestic league champion of the host country. In the United States, the champion of Major League Soccer is determined through the MLS Cup playoffs, rather than regular season performance, and for the 2024 season, that playoff had not yet concluded at the time FIFA needed to confirm its selection. During the mid-season 2024 MLS All-Star Game, MLS Commissioner Don Garber stated that the slot could be awarded to the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield winner, the MLS Cup 2024 winner, or via a playoff between the two. On October 19, 2024, FIFA announced that Inter Miami CF would represent the host nation as winners of the Supporters' Shield, awarding the slot before the start of the 2024 MLS Cup playoffs and after Inter Miami had already secured the Shield. FIFA stated that this decision aligned with past precedent, where clubs that won silverware in a league-style format were prioritised for the host slot, and that the announcement had been delayed due to procedural timelines for confirming regulations. Although the decision drew scrutiny from some sections of the media and fanbase, particularly regarding its timing and the involvement of Lionel Messi, others viewed it as a practical resolution in keeping with the tournament's structure and historical practice. Inter Miami were later eliminated from the playoffs by Atlanta United FC in the first round on November 10, but head coach Gerardo Martino defended the club's inclusion on the grounds that the Supporters' Shield constituted a valid and recognised form of domestic achievement.",

The announcement raised concerns among some fans regarding the Trump administration's deportation policy, especially as those detained could potentially face indefinite detention or be transferred to other countries such as El Salvador.

    "text": "The tournament intensified the rivalry between European teams and the rest of the world, in particular the South Americans. Initially the debate involved how well the non-European teams would fare against the European teams; it then intensified when South American teams began to record victories against their European counterparts. Some South American managers, fans, and journalists also tried to dismiss European criticism of the tournament as \"loser excuses\" and a \"symbol of European arrogance and elitism\". Commentators questioned whether European dominance had been overstated, with analysis suggesting that the myth of superiority was being tested by results on the pitch. In response, Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique remarked that South Americans had no need to compare themselves with Europeans, emphasising the shared global stature of both footballing regions and pointing to the widespread recruitment of South American players by European clubs. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola offered a more supportive view of South American competitiveness, arguing that European fans should not be surprised when clubs from the region secure wins and that such outcomes reflect the real global balance of quality in football. The increased attention to Brazilian clubs also led to a sharp spike in global interest in the Brazilian League, with Google Trends reporting the highest search volume for the term since 2020. While the performances reignited continental pride, the on-field results remained competitive; in twelve direct UEFA–CONMEBOL encounters, European clubs registered six wins, South American clubs won three times, and three matches ended in draws.",

David Strode told reporters his children's preaching was necessitated by racial integration, the teaching of evolution and sex education in public schools. Duffey was suspended from school five times during the 1987–88 school year. In May 1988, five hundred residents of Marion signed a petition asking that the family obey school rules or move out of town. The children's idiosyncratic style of preaching consisted of shouting biblical passages concerning Christian views of Hell and sin at their classmates. In the summer of 1988, Strode appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live, multiple times on Sally, and at least 14 other television talk-show hosts sought interviews with the preaching children who had become a source of controversy in their mountain town. On the first day of the 1988–89 school year, Strode was suspended again when he told the school principal to go to Hell.",

France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. Its collapse initiated a period of relative decline in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. This led to the establishment of the French Third Republic, with a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War.

    "text": "Originally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name France comes from the Latin Francia, or 'realm of the Franks'. The name of the Franks is related to the English word frank ('free'): the latter stems from the Old French franc ('free, noble, sincere'), and ultimately from the Medieval Latin word francus ('free, exempt from service; a freeman, a Frank'), a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym *Frank. It has been suggested that the meaning 'free' was adopted because after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation, or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves. The etymology of *Frank is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frankōn, which translates as 'javelin' or 'lance' (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the francisca), although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.",

At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.

Regarding the general view that Drake introduced singing in mainstream hip-hop, the publication said that at the height of Auto-Tune in hip-hop during the late 2000s, \"there were virtually no artists who were both a legit rapper and a legit crooner who delivered velvety smooth pop/R&B hybrid vocals that could exist separately from his hip-hop songs\". Commenting on Drake's Take Care, Elias Leight of Rolling Stone noticed in 2020 that \"now nearly every singer raps, and nearly every rapper sings\", as many artists \"have borrowed or copied the template of [the album] that the boldness of the original is easily forgotten\", according to the writer.",

Writing for Bloomberg, Lucas Shaw commented Drake's popularity has influenced the promotion of music, with Certified Lover Boy attaining large commercial success despite relatively minimal orthodox marketing techniques, stating \"fans are consuming Drake's [music] in a way that is different to others\". He also noted the album as novel in relation to consumption, with each song having relatively equivalent streams, as opposed to a dominant single(s). Justin Charity of The Ringer noted Drake's signature of producing \"half-hearted\" performances on songs to create a \"natural and off-the-cuff\" effect has become the \"obvious touchpoint for [subsequent] male R&B singers\". Charity further wrote Drake's success in the genre is \"so thorough that it's all but impossible to hear certain vintages of R&B without hearing Drake\".",

But although her mother signed, the contract lacked her father's signature, so the judge refused to validate the contract, despite Irwin's father being naturalist and television personality Steve Irwin, who died in a stingray incident in 2006. The judge later validated the contract once Steve Irwin's death certificate was presented to the court, resulting in Bindi receiving a $350,000 paycheck from the show.",
