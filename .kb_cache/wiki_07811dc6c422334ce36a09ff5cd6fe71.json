Israel's war on Gaza led to widespread protests and spillover conflicts into numerous other countries, most notably Lebanon, which was invaded by Israel in October. This followed an intensification of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. In September, Israel escalated an offensive against the group, which resulted in the killing of the Secretary-General, Hassan Nasrallah. Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, had also been assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran in July, and his successor Yahya Sinwar was killed by the Israel Defense Forces in October. In November, heavy fighting resumed in the Syrian civil war, leading to the toppling of Ba'athist Syria, with Bashar al-Assad fleeing Syria in December. The year also saw a rise in activity by the Houthi movement which contributed to a crisis in the Red Sea that impacted global shipping.",

The European Parliament also held elections. Among democracies, over 80% saw the incumbent party lose support compared to the last election, including many significant losses. In countries like Japan, Botswana, and South Africa, incumbent parties that had dominated domestic politics for decades lost their majorities and either relinquished power or are holding on through coalitions with minor parties. Bassirou Diomaye Faye won the 2024 Senegalese presidential election, becoming the first opposition candidate to win in the first round since the country's independence. In Sri Lanka, voters delivered a landslide victory to the National People's Power, previously a minor party. On November 5, 2024, Republican Donald Trump won the 2024 United States presidential election, becoming the first U.S. president to be elected to a nonconsecutive second term since 1892. The French and German governments lost votes of no confidence. In December, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol's attempt to declare and impose martial law was thwarted by members of parliament, sparking a political crisis that led to his impeachment and the impeachment of acting president Han Duck-soo.",

The actors are up to the task, however.\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire remarked the film's dark humor, adding, \"what we do get from Howard\u2019s latest is a strong reminder of his handle on not just craft and casting, but also story and tone. No film about the utter demise of a supposed utopia \u2014 a real one, to boot! \u2014 and the utter infallibility of human beings should be this fun, but we\u2019re lucky this one is.\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted the screenplay's attention to historical detail as a strength, adding: \"The only weakness of the movie is that, because it\u2019s a true story, it can\u2019t rearrange the order of events for maximum drama. Thus, what is essentially the climax of the film comes about three quarters in, and the rest of it, while never less than interesting, feels like falling action.

    "text": "Owen Gleiberman, writing for Variety, gave the film an unfavorable assessment, finding its characters \"more dislikable by the minute\" and described it as \"a madcap version of Lord of the Flies... Eden lopes along, without energy or purpose, but with a great deal of random showboating.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter was also critical of the film, noting that its \"prevailing overwrought tone lands more cartoonish than satirical, while a protracted running time accentuates the film\u2019s deficiencies\" and found the performances underwhelming, though he praised Sweeney's performance, noting that she \"manages to retain the viewer\u2019s sympathy and her character\u2019s sanity as the decent pillar of stability that is Margaret.\"",
