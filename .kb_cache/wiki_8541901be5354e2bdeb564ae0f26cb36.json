Following the third crash, the FAA restricted the maximum speed of Electras pending determination of the causes. After an extensive investigation, two of the crashes (those of September 1959 and March 1960) were identified as due to insufficiently strong engine mounts, unable to damp a whirling motion that could affect the outboard engines. When the oscillation was transmitted to the wings, a severe vertical vibration escalated, tearing off the wings. The company implemented a costly modification program, labelled the Lockheed Electra Achievement Program, which strengthened the engine mounts and the wing structures supporting the mounts, and replaced some wing skins with thicker material. At its own expense, Lockheed modified all surviving Electras of the 145 built at that time, the process taking 20 days for each aircraft.

Converted by Aerosystems Division of LTV to be used as both ELINT and COMINT platform, the three P-3As were known as \"black\" P-3As under Project Axial. Officially transferred to the CIA on June/July 1964, the first of three \"black\" P-3As arrived in Taiwan and officially transferred to ROCAF's secret Black Bat Squadron on 22 June 1966. Armed with four Sidewinder short range AAM missiles for self-defense, the three \"black\" P-3A flew peripheral missions along China's coast to collect SIGINT and air samples. When the project was terminated in January 1967, all three \"black\" P-3As were flown to NAS Alameda, CA, for long-term storage. In September 1967, Lockheed at Burbank, converted two of the three aircraft (149669 and 149678) into the only two EP-3B examples in existence, while the third aircraft (149673) was converted by Lockheed in 1969\u20131970 to serve as a development aircraft for various electronic programs. The two EP-3Bs known as \"Bat Rack\", owing to their service with Taiwan's \"Black Bat\" Squadron, were issued to U.S. Navy's VQ-1 Squadron in 1969 and deployed to Da Nang, Vietnam. Later, the two EP-3Bs were converted to EP-3E ARIES, along with seven EP-3As. The two EP-3Es retired in the 1980s, when replaced by 12 EP-3E ARIES II versions.",
