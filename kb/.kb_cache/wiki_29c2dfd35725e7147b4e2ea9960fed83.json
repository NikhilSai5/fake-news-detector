In a study that investigated the DNA methylation profile of multiple myeloma cells and normal plasma cells, a gradual demethylation from stem cells to plasma cells was observed, with site-specific gain of methylation. Loss of methylation is associated with gene activation and gain of methylation is correlated with gene silencing. The dysregulated methylation pattern in multiple myeloma results in the activation of specific oncogenes and repression of specific tumor suppressor genes. The observed methylation pattern of CpG within intronic regions with enhancer-related chromatin marks in multiple myeloma is similar to undifferentiated precursor and stem cells.

No breeds appear overrepresented in case reviews that have been conducted. Diagnosis in dogs is usually delayed due to the initial nonspecificity and range of clinical signs possible. Diagnosis usually involves bone marrow studies, X-rays, and plasma-protein studies. In dogs, protein studies usually reveal the monoclonal gammaglobulin elevation to be IgA or IgG in an equal number of cases. In rare cases the globulin elevation is IgM, which is referred to as Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia. The prognosis for initial control and return to good quality of life in dogs is good;  43% of dogs started on a combination chemotherapeutic protocol achieved complete remission.  Long-term survival is normal, with a median of 540 days reported. The disease eventually recurs, becoming resistant to available therapies. The complications of kidney failure, sepsis, or pain can lead to an animal's death, frequently by euthanasia.",
