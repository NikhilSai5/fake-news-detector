While out, Frank finds his son Lip (Jody Latham), and invites him along with his granddaughter, Katie (Bethany Thompson). He reaches an understanding with his son, who then treats him much better. After Frank has begun a three-way relationship with prostitutes Sherilee (Sarah Totty) and Derilee (Sue Vincent), Derilee's husband Baxter arrives at the Gallagher household and holds Frank, Stella and Derilee hostage at gunpoint. While negotiating with Baxter for their freedom, Monica returns to Chatsworth to take Stella's place in the hostage situation. However, Stella ends up running back inside, with Monica also being held captive. While Derilee and Baxter solve their differences, Frank and Monica have sex, resulting in Monica falling pregnant with twins. Frank was arrested and visited by her and tells her to have an abortion, however one of the twins survives, and she gives birth to Ben Gallagher in The Jockey. Frank shows a lack of interest in the child and leaves care to Stella. Meanwhile, Monica feigns bereavement over the baby she \"miscarried\". Frank's oldest daughter, Fiona McBride (Anne-Marie Duff), returns to Chatsworth with Carl and Lip. Frank learns he has a grandson from Fiona who attempts to make Frank and Monica see that their disastrous parenting is only going to damage Stella and Ben. Fiona decides to take Stella and Ben back to Amsterdam with her, leaving them in the care of her old friend, Kev Ball (Dean Lennox Kelly), however he loses them. Frank has an argument with Monica and decides to leave Chatsworth since he believes he is better off without his family. However, Stella follows Frank to the bus stop with Ben in her arms, as Frank rages at an upset Stella that she was a mistake and that she ruined his life, leading to her sadly walk away alone. A guilty Frank later finds Stella and Ben at a local park; he apologizes for his harsh behaviour and confirms that he does love her, much to her joy. He lets Stella play while he finally takes an active role in caring for Ben. Frank soon takes them back to the Gallagher household, walking into Fiona and Monica fighting over the upbringing of the two children. He refuses to let Fiona take his youngest children.

Kash Karib (Chris Bisson) was his only long-term boyfriend, though he has a brief relationship with Sean Bennett, and an ongoing friendship, sometimes sexual, with Micky Maguire (Ciar\u00e1n Griffiths). Because he is unaware of his parentage at the time, Ian also unknowingly sleeps with his half-brother. Ian sees Sean Bennett at their biological father's funeral and later tells the truth to Sean, who wants to keep seeing Ian, but eventually agrees that they can not ignore their familial relationship. Beginning in the fourth series, Ian has a number of relationships with women. He repeatedly has sex with a girl he is briefly hiding in his home for her protection, but when she asks him to leave with her, he declines, knowing a relationship would not work. He has a relationship of convenience with Mandy Maguire (Samantha Siddall), to protect his secret, which nearly turns sexual when they're both at a low point, but they fumble about until Ian decides it's a bad idea. In the seventh series, Ian begins a serious relationship with Maxine Donnelly (Joanna Higson). When Maxine's brother, Bruce (Philip Hill-Pearson) asks if their being in a relationship means Ian is now \"bisexual\", Ian pauses, before saying he just believes he has found the right person.",

Lip (Jody Latham), Carl (Elliott Tittensor) and Liam (Johnny Bennett) are her brothers. Her sisters are Fiona (Anne-Marie Duff) and Stella (Nikita Brownlee); her half-brothers are Ian (Gerard Kearns) and Nigel; and her half-sister is Delia. Although Debbie is only 16 (at the time of her last appearance on the show in 2009), she is old beyond her years because she grew up without a mother and undertook the majority of the domestic tasks, At the start of the series Debbie tended to use her childlike innocence to get out of any mess she or family get themselves into. Since Fiona went to Amsterdam, Debbie is often tasked with saving the family from ruin. For example, she steps in when Liam denounces God and the school he attends makes a move to expel him. Although the results are disastrous, she shows herself to be a diligent individual upon whom her family can depend. Originally Debbie was presented as a slightly unusual and awkward child, she retains her high intelligence and resourcefulness throughout the show. This allows Debbie to be successful when she becomes head of the household and takes care of the domestic duties such as cooking, ironing, cleaning and taking Liam to school. She also provides her family members with a high level of emotional support. As a consequence, Debbie missed out on socialising and has become mature beyond her years.

Unlike Fiona, Lip, Ian and Carl, Debbie admires him and often shows her love for him, often seen to be the most affected when he is in danger or trouble. For example, she screams in terror when she believes that Frank's body has been found in a nearby canal. Throughout the series, Frank often lets Debbie down and seems to be unappreciative of her efforts to keep the family together. For example, during some of his drunken rants, he presents himself as being lumbered with children whom he has the sole responsibility of caring for them and seems to forget occasionally what an asset Debbie is to the family. Debbie's feelings of closeness to Frank often leave her the most vulnerable to being let down by him. Debbie's loyalty to her father is occasionally rewarded, and it is strongly suggested that Frank appreciates \"Little Debbie\" more than anyone else in the world, though that changes when he tells her crush Luke that she sleeps around the estate in hopes she doesn't sacrifice money for charity, and even when Frank tries to do good and give her money for a trip she still refuses to forgive him. Debbie also detests her mother more than the rest of the family, refusing to forgive her for abandoning them years ago or for her continued laziness and self-absorption. She did respond sympathetically when more details became clear regarding Monica's abusive childhood at her mother's hands. In contrast, Debbie was close to Frank's ex-wife, Sheila (Maggie O'Neill).",

Carl, Kelly, and Libby all feel suspicious of their friendship, especially when Libby sees Liam wearing a dress (Liam wore one of Debbie's dresses as it reminded him of her smell). Liam defends Reggie, but when Reggie, knowing that he was close to death, desperately hugs him and doesn't want to let go. Liam completely misinterprets Reggie's reasons, and flees the house. However, Liam begins to realise he was wrong about Reggie and returns to apologise and sit with Reggie as he dies.",

Debbie was Liam's main caregiver and role model since Fiona's departure from Chatsworth in series 2, being the main nurturing influence in his life from the ages of four to ten. Debbie and Liam had such a strong bond with each other, that she would frequently use his help in various activities.

In series 8, when the family received the news of Debbie's death in Afghanistan, Liam was willing to travel on his own to personally break the news to Fiona. But there was no need, as the news turned out to be a cruel hoax by the returning Monica. When Monica came back, Liam finally confronted his mother on her attitude toward her family. Monica replied that her relationship with his father was \"above right or wrong\". When Monica left after her deception was revealed, Liam followed her to the bus stop, where her latest Lesbian lover greeted her. Liam realized this was the same person whom earlier dressed as an army NCO to falsely inform them of Debbie's death. Liam attends Frank's stagnight to keep him out of trouble, but the other drunken revellers playfully tie Frank up and leave him in a cemetery, while taking Liam to a brothel and leaving him with a prostitute. Libby is furious when she finds out, but Liam assures her that he didn't have sex. He only paid the girl for her time with him, and won the money back in a game of Three Card Brag. When Frank goes missing after his stag night, Monica demands custody of Liam and Stella. When she came to collect them, Liam forced Monica to take him rather than Stella, otherwise he would make her life difficult. Liam left with Monica after saying he would come back as soon as Monica gets her new house from the council, which was the true reason she wanted Liam and Stella in the first place. In the fifth episode, just before Frank and Libby's wedding, Carl reads a best man's speech written by Liam, which turns out to be a personal message from him. Liam says that he's decided to stay with Monica, saying that she's had a hard life and that he wants to help her love herself, much to the sadness of everyone in attendance. Liam had left the Chatsworth Estate to live with Monica. Although, by Series 11, Monica came to live with Frank, without Liam, indicating that Liam left his mother sometime after the events in Series 8. In the final episode of Shameless, Liam was stated by Lip to be a practicing Buddhist.",

He was a guest character in the first series of Shameless, became a main character in the second series, and left along with Veronica and Kev Ball (Dean Lennox Kelly) in the first episode of the fourth series. Marty was originally something of a burden to the other characters, setting things alight when he got angry, particularly whenever he found Carol with much younger men.

His Tourette's syndrome often creates uncomfortable situations for him, causing him to reveal otherwise secret information or offend those who are not used to him by insulting/swearing. However, later in the series Debbie Gallagher (Rebecca Ryan) teaches Marty to use other words such as buttermilk and spongecake instead of swearing, and his pyromania seems to calm down when he starts a relationship with Sue Garland (Gillian Kearney). The two live relatively happily in the Gallagher household for a time, until Marty accompanies Kev and Veronica in a scheme to buy a Romanian baby from an orphanage.

However, the drug-dealer who framed Carl Gallagher (Elliott Tittensor) and Chesney, called Jimmy D, in his desperation to prevent them from informing the police of the murder he committed, roams around Chatsworth with his associates, terrorising the neighbourhood, and stepping on the toes of the Maguire family in the process. Shane declares Jimmy a marked man. The next morning, Chesney is still hiding in the shop when Joe assures him that things are going to turn out okay. Then a flashback is shown that during Shane's interrogation of rival gang-members for Jimmy's whereabouts, Joe had attacked and presumably murdered Jimmy.",

All of them start spreading rumours about her being a drug dealer, until Faith tells them the truth. She reveals that the police might have found the body of her brother, Razz, who had been missing. Frank uses this as a way to get more sponsors for her charity run. Faith is disgusted and tells Elektra that she was put in care because she told a teacher that she lived alone, which resulted in them calling social services. The police tell her that the body was not a match; she hides in the garden and finds Floss who helps her gain some composure. The next day she completes her charity run with everyone supporting her. In the second series of The Dumping Ground, after Faith is hit by a car, she is temporarily in a wheelchair, and becomes increasingly negative. This is unlike Faith, as she's very optimistic and ambitious most of the time, but feeling like she was stuck in the wheelchair made her think she would never run or walk again. She becomes mean and aggressive towards the younger kids mainly, making Harry and Floss to clean her room for a \"prize\" and ordering them about. She ends up teasing Harry, treating him like a baby. When Faith wants to watch a movie, but Mo, Floss and Harry were already watching something, she tells them to get lost and Mo tells her that she's become really mean, and that he's going to tell Mike. That causes Faith to call Mo a grass. Frank witnesses this and when Faith starts to order Frank about, Frank gives her a piece of his mind by telling her that she's not useless, she's in a wheelchair and she will get better. He then goes on to tell her that he has to talk really slow every day of his life so people can understand him. This changes Faith's recent behaviour and she reverts to her caring and friendly self, but she does have a few snappy and mean moments in later episodes.",

At the time, Aileen was very poor, and found it hard to find the money to take care of herself and Alex. One day, when Alex was just five years old, Aileen took Alex out for a drive, got him a comic and bottle of pop. But then she left on the street outside his father's workplace and drove off without him, leaving him alone on the street. She felt like she was doing the right thing for Alex at the time, and thought she was protecting him, but any stranger could've just taken Alex. Alex ended up living with his father, but he was never around, he'd either be at work or would just go away for days. And eventually, Alex was put into care. Alex often ran away from his care homes, and at just 12 years old, he found himself homeless and living on the streets. Cold, alone, frightened and hungry, Alex learnt quickly to take care of himself as everyone else in his life so far that he'd ever trusted has left him and felt like everyone who just pretends to care just goes. Alex spent about two years on the street and ended up becoming friends with an old man, who was also homeless, called George. George described Alex as being the grandson he never had, and they both promised to look out for each other through thick and thin.",

Jody runs away to The Dumping Ground, giving the others presents and Mike (Connor Byrne) arranges for Jody to stay the night and for their social worker, Rob (Neil Armstrong) to sort things out the following day. Kingsley and Denise arrive the following day to collect Jody and she reluctantly agrees to return. Jody tells the others she needs the presents back as they belong to Kingsley, who has no idea she has got them. Carmen, Tyler, Tee (Mia McKenna-Bruce) and Lily (Jessie Williams) go to Jody's when Carmen is unable to get hold of Jody on a mobile she gave her. Carmen and Tyler sneak into the house and go to Jody's room, which is filled with stolen, expensive goods. When Kingsley arrives home, Carmen and Tyler hide in Jody's room and Kingsley is angry when he finds the door unlocked and Carmen's mobile phone, thinking it's Jody's and he locks Jody in her bedroom. Tee sends Elektra (Jessica Revell) a video of Tyler sending a Morse code for Gus (Noah Marullo) to work out. Gus works out they are saying \"S.O.S\". When Kingsley discovers Carmen and Tyler have been with Jody the whole time, he threatens them to stay quiet. Gina arrives and she is furious with Denise for not protecting Jody from Kingsley, as Denise was meant to be the parent. And what made Gina even more angry was that Denise knew what Kingsley was doing to Jody and never said anything. Luke convinces his mother that the Dumping Ground is the best place for Jody as she is better off with Mike and Gina, and Jody returns for The Dumping Ground.",

And that she was sad that her mother was ignoring her after she testified against Kingsley in court, and expressed how she felt about her mother and the way she treated Jody. PoPo suggested for Jody to write a letter to her mother, explaining her how she feels about her mother and what she would really want to say to her, and for when she had finished writing the letter to fold it up and put in a draw or box somewhere and forget about it. So she would've gotten her feelings out without actually saying them to her. But at the time, Jody and Ryan Reeves were having a rivalry and as Ryan overheard one of Jody and PoPo's conversations, went into Jody's room to find the letter she wrote to her mother to express her feelings. Ryan ended up posting the letter through a letter box round the corner, but luckily Jody asked her older brother Luke to not let her mum see the letter.",
