The Indian Army was established on 1 April 1895 alongside the long established presidency armies of the East India Company, which too were absorbed into it in 1903. Some princely states maintained their own armies which formed the Imperial Service Troops which, along with the Indian Army formed the land component of the Armed Forces of the Crown of India, responsible for the defence of the Indian Empire. The Imperial Service Troops were merged into the Indian Army after independence.

Diplomatic tensions eased after the Lahore Summit was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism was short-lived. In mid-1999, Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the Kargil district of India. These had been vacated by the Indian Army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were to be reoccupied in spring. The troops that took control of these areas received important support, of both arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital Srinagar\u2013Leh Highway (NH 1A), Batalik, and Dras.",

However, since the heights were under Pakistani control, India was at a clear strategic disadvantage. From their observation posts, the Pakistani forces had a clear line-of-sight to lay down indirect artillery fire on NH 1A, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians. This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main supply route. Thus, the Indian Army's priority was to recapture peaks near NH 1A. This resulted in Indian troops first targeting the Tiger Hill and Tololing complex in Dras. This was soon followed by more attacks on the Batalik\u2013Turtok sub-sector, which provided access to Siachen Glacier. Point 4590, which had the nearest view of the NH 1A, was successfully recaptured by Indian forces on 14 June.",

Once the NH 1A area was cleared, the Indian Army turned to drive the invading force back across the Line of Control. The Battle of Tololing, among others, slowly tilted the war in India's favour. Nevertheless, some Pakistani posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140), which fell only later in the war. As the operation was fully underway, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in posts that were in the line-of-sight. At many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults, which were slow and took a heavy toll, given the steep ascents that had to be made on peaks as high as 5,500 m (18,000 ft). Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges they had lost. According to official accounts, an estimated 75%\u201380% of the enemy-occupied area, and nearly all the high ground, was back under Indian control.",

The IBGs are meant to transform the overall field formation of the Indian Army. As of July 2019, the new concept of formations had been test-bedded with the IX Corps (Rising Star Corps) and were being reorganised based on the basis of feedbacks. The formation of a specific IBG amd its resource allocation would depend on three T's \u2014 Threat, Terrain and Task. The formation would have mobilisation time of 12\u201348 hours. The IBG will replace the traditional field formation of Commands\u2013Corps\u2013Divisions\u2013Brigades with Commands and Corps being the largest static formation spread across a defined geography and the largest mobile formation, respectively. As of 2019, each IBG fields 5,000 troops and includes infantry, armoured, artillery and air defence units. The composition of IBG also depends on its nature \u2013 offensive or defensive. While Offensive IBG will be designed to be mobilised at the earliest to thrust into enemy territory for strike operations, the Defensive IBG will be tasked to hold ground at vulnerable points where enemy action is expected.",

By May 2022, the IBGs were test-bedded by IX Corps and further validated by the XVII Corps.

These agile and compact battalions, evolving from the Ghatak Platoon concept, are designed as shock troops to undertake clandestine missions or deliver surprise strikes under high-risk conditions the enemy lines to inflict maximum damage. The units are being raised under the long-standing \u201cson of the soil\u201d concept which is used by the Indian Army while raising battalions. Under this concept, the Army Chief has tasked the individual Infantry Regimental Centres to select, train, and depute personnel from their respective units, which will be affiliated with and operate alongside specific corps. The selected soldiers will be trained for 2\u20133 months for their first phase under the Regimental Centre, followed by a month-long second phase of advanced training under the aegis of Special Forces training centres of the troops' respective deployment theatres.
