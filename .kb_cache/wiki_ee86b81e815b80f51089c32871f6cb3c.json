These missiles roll in flight (900\u20131,200 rpm) so steering the missile requires just a single pair of control surfaces, unlike roll-stabilized missiles, which require separate control surfaces for pitch and yaw. Both 9M313 and 9M39 missiles contain a gas generator, which drives a small gas turbine to provide electrical power, and the pistons, which move the canards used to steer the missile in a bang-bang mode. In addition to that, two exhaust tubes of the gas generator are placed perpendicular to the steering canards to provide maneuverability immediately after launch when the missile airspeed is too low for canards to be effective. Later versions of Igla are reported to use proportional control to drive the canards, which enables greater precision and less oscillation of the flight path.",

On 29 November 2022, the MoD released Request for Proposal for the procurement following the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) from the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) under MoD. The requirement is for 425,213 units of carbine (418,455 for the Army and 6,758 for the Navy). The order will be split between the two of the lowest bidders, L1 (255,128 units) and L2 (170,085 units). The carbine mass must be within the range of 3-3.5 kg and must have a range of more than 200 m and a cyclic rate of firing 600 rounds/min. The procurement is under Buy 'Indian' category, that is the guns must have more than 60% indigenous content. As of June 2024, 15 vendors are competing for the contract and summer trials of the products are underway while winter trials will be conducted later this year. In June 2025, the DRDO-Bharat Forge's Close Quarter Battle (CQB) Carbine had emerged as the lowest bidder for the tender. The carbines will be manufactured by Kalyani Strategic Systems Limited (KSSL) in its Khed City or Jejuri facility, both near Pune. The gun has an effective range of 200 m (660 ft), weight of 3.3 kg (7.3 lb) and supports a 30-round magazine compatible with both NATO-standard and INSAS ammunition. Meanwhile, Adani Defence & Aerospace became the L2 bidder and is expected to deliver its Jeet carbine, a derivative of IWI Galil ACE design, from its Gwalior facility earlier acquired from Punj Lloyd Raksha. The contracts would be worth \u20b91,700 crore (US$200 million) and \u20b91,100 crore (US$130 million), respectively. The contracts, with a combined worth of \u20b92,770 crore (US$330 million), was signed in September 2025 and deliveries are expected to commence in 2026.",

Top-attack mines are designed to engage armoured vehicles from above, where protection is typically weaker. They employ a combination of seismic, acoustic, and infrared sensors to detect and classify targets. Upon detection, the mine launches a submunition\u2014such as an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) or shaped charge\u2014in a near-vertical trajectory to penetrate the vehicle\u2019s top armour. Some variants use explosively generated shock waves to achieve a similar effect. These mines are effective against heavily armoured platforms that are resistant to conventional underbelly mines and can be deployed in various terrains, including urban environments.
