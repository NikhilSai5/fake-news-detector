The operation is successful, and Wani is killed in a gunfight without any of the civilians present at the compound being harmed. This provides separatist leader Yakub Shiekh and his allies an opportunity to portray him as a martyr, and they launch an agitation across the state with covert political backing, as well as replacing Wani with another terrorist leader, Zakir Naikoo.

She brings the NIA into Kashmir in order to stabilise the situation, which has worsened after the elimination of Burhan Wani, to investigate all terror cases in the state. Later, Salahuddin Jalal (based on Omar Abdullah) arrives at Delhi, and is guarded by Zooni, who was originally based in Kashmir, but was demoted after the  neutralisation of Wani. Meanwhile, Parveena Andrabi (Mehbooba Mufti) meets with Rajeshwari to discuss the situation in Kashmir, who criticises the Central Government's operations in Kashmir without the State's approval. Jalal, while going to meet the PM, talks to Zooni, mentioning her father, Kabir (a whistleblower who was framed in the J&K Bank scam), who was found dead in a lake in Kashmir by suicide, much to the frustration of Zooni. The Government of India was unable to investigate the scam due to Article 370. Rajeshwari meets with Zooni, trying to convince her to go back to Kashmir to try to abrogate Article 370. She refuses, but Rajeshwari asks her to sleep on it. After Rajeshwari tells Zooni that Kashmir is now under Governor's Rule, she accepts the offer under the condition that two more people can be on the team.",

She discusses a stone-pelting incident in Anatang, where youth were handed cash to throw stones. Shamsher Abdali was the primary suspect for the funding. They decide to investigate his dry fruit business if it has any leads, but it fails to obtain any evidence. Zooni, however, suggests that Abdali may may be using a different method rather than cash. So they instead raid a dry fruit warehouse, and discover that the workers work for a contractor. After tapping his phone, they discover that code-names are used in phone conversations. All of the code-names used are names of arch-angels in Islam such as Azrael. Among them is one named Jibril, revealed to be Abdali, who is both an ISI agent and double agent working for Khawar, a former senior of Zooni, who reveals his location under pressure. Despite a planned mob placed to stop them by Andrabi, Zooni and the CRPF manage to secure Abdali, who injures himself in custody to stall them for time while Jalal and Andrabi try to form a coalition government and gain control of the Valley once the Governor\u2019s rule is removed. However, the fax machine at the Indian ministry doesn\u2019t work, and President\u2019s rule is imposed on Kashmir, foiling their plans. Zooni learns from Rajeshwari that they plan on abrogating Article 370.
