Although he occasionally killed or attempted to kill men and children, Rader typically targeted women. His victims were often attacked in their homes, then bound, sometimes with objects from their homes, and either suffocated with a plastic bag or manually strangled with a ligature.",

In addition, he stole keepsakes from his female victims, including underwear, driver's licenses and personal items. In 1979, BTK suddenly went quiet, and despite an exhaustive investigation, the case grew into one of the most infamous cold cases in American history. Rader would later confess to killing three further victims between 1985 and 1991 that were not initially linked to BTK but were confirmed to be his doing through DNA and items found in his possession.",

Rader then drove to Park City Baptist Church, to which he had a key because of his Boy Scouts duties. Rader left the church, walking through wheat fields and cutting through a cemetery to get to Davis's home.

Davis refused and told him to leave, at which point Rader informed her that he had a gun, a club, and a knife on his person. Davis then became cooperative. Rader obtained the keys to her car and rattled around in the kitchen, pretending to look for food. Rader believed that while he was tying her up with a pair of her pantyhose that Davis realized that he was going to kill her. She begged for her life, prompting Rader to strangle her with the pantyhose.

The cover of a 2011 issue retitled Charia Hebdo (French for Sharia Weekly), featured a cartoon of Muhammad, whose depiction is forbidden in most interpretations of Islam, with some Persian exceptions. The newspaper's office was fire-bombed and its website hacked. In 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, including nude caricatures; this came days after a series of violent attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East, purportedly in response to the anti-Islamic film Innocence of Muslims, prompting the French government to close embassies, consulates, cultural centres, and international schools in about 20 Muslim countries. Riot police surrounded the newspaper's offices to protect it against possible attacks.",

Abdul, age 14, said \"of course everyone stood for the one minute silence, and that includes all Muslims... I did it for those who were killed, but not for Charlie. I have no pity for him, he had no respect for us Muslims\". It also reported that for most students at the Paul Eluard high school in Saint-Denis, freedom of expression is perceived as being \"incompatible with their faith\". For Erica, who describes herself as Catholic, \"there are wrongs on both sides\". A fake bomb was planted in the faculty lounge at the school.",
