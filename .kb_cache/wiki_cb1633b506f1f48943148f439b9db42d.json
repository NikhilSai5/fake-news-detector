Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 subpostmasters were wrongfully convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting based on faulty Horizon data, with about 700 of these prosecutions carried out by the Post Office. Other subpostmasters were prosecuted but not convicted, forced to cover illusory shortfalls caused by Horizon with their own money, or had their contracts terminated. The court cases, criminal convictions, imprisonments, loss of livelihoods and homes, debts, and bankruptcies led to stress, illness and family breakdowns, and were linked to at least thirteen suicides. In 2024, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak described the scandal as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history.",

In 2012, following pressure from campaigners and Members of Parliament, the Post Office appointed forensic accountants from the firm Second Sight to conduct an investigation into Horizon.

The case was heard before judge Richard Havery in December 2006 and January 2007.

In September 2023, solicitor Stephen Dilley, who had represented the Post Office in the case, told the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry that the Post Office had known Castleton would not be able to pay if he lost, but wanted to send \"a message that they were willing to defend the Fujitsu Horizon\".

Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5\u20139 vote and then in the full Senate, 42\u201358.",

Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify. The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment. The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52\u201348 vote, with Biden opposed. Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.

The pardon's sweeping extent was \"unprecedented\". According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Richard Nixon's or other \"controversial\" pardons:The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014\u2014the year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers.Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise. Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff. In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\", blaming \"political pressure\" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction. Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution.

Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal. In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \"an unprecedented attack\" by the Chinese, which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" toward China and Taiwan. The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed. In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.",

Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip.

A February 2024 American Political Science Association poll of historians and scholars ranked Biden the 14th-greatest president, diverging from public assessments. The pollsters noted that Biden's ranking was unusually high for a presidency without military victories or institutional expansion. The experts polled generally regarded Biden's signature accomplishment as his victory over Trump in the 2020 election, which was perceived as helping to protect and restore political and institutional norms in U.S. government.",

    "text": "When Biden left office in 2025, journalists and many Democrats viewed his presidency as a failure due to age and health concerns, public frustration over inflation, and Harris's loss to Trump in the 2024 presidential election. The Guardian called the conclusion of Biden's presidency a \"tragedy\", particularly because Biden was succeeded by Trump after previously defeating him. Journalist Ronald Brownstein compared Biden to Jimmy Carter: Biden's presidency was overshadowed by the 2021\u20132023 inflation surge, much as the 1970s energy crisis and stagflation overshadowed Carter's presidency. Both men were Democrats and served a single term as president. Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election was compared to Lyndon B. Johnson's withdrawal from the 1968 presidential election.",
