Meanwhile, the growing dissatisfaction with Ch\u00e1vez among those in the military due to his aggressive manner and alliances with Cuba and paramilitaries led multiple officers to call on Ch\u00e1vez to resign. Demonstrations and counter-demonstrations took place on a weekly basis as the country became increasingly divided. Retired military officers, former politicians, union leaders, and spokespeople for the Catholic Church claimed they had military support to remove Ch\u00e1vez from power, with an April 6 CIA intelligence report warning that plotters would try to exploit social unrest from upcoming opposition demonstrations for his removal.",

On 9 April, a general strike was called by the trade union organization National Federation of Trade Unions (Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Venezuela, CTV). The proposed strike was in response to Ch\u00e1vez's appointments to prominent posts in Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA. Two days later in Caracas, up to one million Venezuelans marched in opposition to Ch\u00e1vez. After stopping at its original end point, the march continued towards the presidential palace, Miraflores, where government supporters and Bolivarian Circles were holding their own rally. Upon the opposition's arrival, the two sides confronted each other. A shootout started at the Llaguno Overpass, near the Miraflores Palace, and by that evening 19 people were dead. Ch\u00e1vez ordered the implementation of Plan \u00c1vila, a military plan to mobilize an emergency force to protect the palace in the event of a coup. As the plan had resulted in the killing of hundreds of Venezuelans during the Caracazo, military high command refused and demanded he resign. President Ch\u00e1vez was subsequently arrested by the military. Ch\u00e1vez's request for asylum in Cuba was denied, and he was ordered to be tried in a Venezuelan court.",

Such opposition to Carmona's moves resulted in his Minister of Defense, Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez, stating that the media was \"opposed\" to Carmona's interim government. Carmona's minister of defense also called on the media to stop reporting the violence so it would not provoke more violent actions. The head of Globovisi\u00f3n reportedly called to CNN in Atlanta \"to request the U.S. network join the blackout.\" Venezuelan television media failed to broadcast news of Ch\u00e1vez supporters retaking of the Miraflores palace; the four major television networks stopped providing news reports altogether.

Another station, Televen, told its viewers 'to stay indoors,' treating them to baseball and soap operas. Globovisi\u00f3n, the country's top 24-hour news station and CNN affiliate, spent much of the day rebroadcasting upbeat footage of Ch\u00e1vez's ouster. An announcer repeatedly cautioned viewers, 'We are living in times of political change'\" while also urging viewers to remain \"prudent\" and not to spread \"false alarms\" or \"rumors\". According to the media, such actions were performed for safety reasons since there were threats against the media organizations. Two of the three major newspapers El Universal and El Nacional cancelled their Sunday editions, for safety reasons. The third major newspaper, \u00daltimas Noticias, printed a limited Sunday edition accurately reflecting events; some tabloids and regional television stations also covered the news. Ch\u00e1vez supporters on 13 April were also creating an intimidating atmosphere, attacking the offices of RCTV, breaking windows and shouting \"The palace is in our hands, why aren't you showing that?\". By 8 o'clock on 13 April, the reinstalled government informed the people of the situation, via state television channels. On 18 April, Globovisi\u00f3n president Alberto Ravell \"asked for forgiveness 'from any viewer who feels we failed them that day'\", further stating that \"Sacrificing our credibility (...) and freedom of expression, we decided not to broadcast images of violence and looting.\"",

To do so, Ch\u00e1vez used a \"two-pronged strategy\" in which his government strengthened its own media and \"closed, browbeaten or infiltrated almost every independent outlet\". In 2004, the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television was passed, allowing the government to censor media in order to \"promote social justice and further the development of the citizenry, democracy, peace, human rights, education, culture, public health, and the nation's social and economic development\". The law, which was extended to the Internet and social media in 2010, requires media companies to \"establish mechanisms to restrict, without delay, the dissemination of messages.\" Violators can be fined up to US$3,000 or 10 percent of one's yearly income, or face suspension of service, while journalists can be arrested with vague charges, including \"conspiracy against the state\" for criticizing the government. In 2007, Ch\u00e1vez announced the shutdown of television broadcaster RCTV, and other stations began toning down dissent to avoid a similar end. In 2009, 34 radio stations were closed for \"technical and administrative reasons\". By the time of Ch\u00e1vez's death in 2013, he left a transformed media atmosphere in Venezuela with the media organizations that opposed him being silenced and an expanding state media as a result. Media workers face legal barriers, defamation lawsuits from Venezuelan officials, and violence.",
