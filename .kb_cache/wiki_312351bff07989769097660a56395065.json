There were also the Sudanese civil and Gaza wars, which had escalated into a famine and humanitarian crisis. In the case of Gaza, President Trump brokered a ceasefire and paved the way for a reconstruction period by November. Internal crises in Armenia, Bangladesh, Ecuador, France, Georgia, Germany, Haiti, Peru, Somalia, and South Korea continued into this year, with the latter leading to President Yoon Suk Yeol's arrest and removal from office. The year has also seen a wave of protests predominantly led by Generation Z, with some, like those in Nepal and Madagascar, resulting in the overthrow of governments. Several brief conflicts out of longstanding tensions emerged mid-year\u2014India\u2013Pakistan in May, Iran\u2013Israel in June, and Cambodia\u2013Thailand in July, in which a leaked phone call involving Thai prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and Cambodian senate president Hun Sen resulted in the removal of the former.",
