During the early 20th century African-Americans were excluded from most mainstream theater in the United States: white Vaudeville refused to book more than one African-American act on a bill and for over a decade no Broadway show used African-American performers at all. Blake and Sissle met F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles for the first time at a fundraising benefit for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1920. Vaudeville's exclusionary practices limited bills to one African-American act per night, so as a result the two leading African-American acting teams knew of each other only by reputation. The four performers agreed that the only feasible way for African-Americans to return to Broadway with dignity would be musical comedy. Miller proposed they collaborate.",

    "text": "Stewart spent three weeks recording Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing \"ahhh\" 16 times for each note of the chromatic scale, building up a \"choir\" of 48 voices for each note of the scale. The main problem facing the band was how to keep the vocal notes going for an infinite length of time, but Creme suggested that they could get around this issue by using tape loops. Stewart created loops of about 12 feet in length by feeding the loop at one end through the tape heads of the stereo recorder in the studio, and at the other end through a capstan roller fixed to the top of a microphone stand, and tensioned the tape. By creating long loops the 'blip' caused by the splice in each tape loop could be drowned out by the rest of the backing track, providing that the splice in each loop did not coincide with any of the others. Having created twelve tape loops, one for each of the 12 notes of the chromatic scale, Stewart played each loop through a separate channel of the mixing desk. This effectively turned the mixing desk into a musical instrument complete with all the notes of the chromatic scale, which the four members together then \"played\", fading up three or four channels at a time to create \"chords\" for the song's melody. Stewart put tape across the bottom of each channel so that it was impossible to completely fade down the tracks for each note, resulting in the constant background of vocals heard throughout the song. Composer and music theory professor Thomas MacFarlane considered the resulting \"ethereal voices\" with distorted synthesised effects a major influence on Billy Joel's hit ballad \"Just the Way You Are\", released two years later.",

The drum sound was very soft and more akin to a heartbeat, in order not to overpower the rest of the track. Creme played piano during the bridge and the middle eight, where it replicated the melody of lyrics that had been discarded. The middle eight is also the only part of the song that contains a bass guitar line, played by Gouldman.

Just at that point the door to the control room opened and our secretary Cathy Redfern looked in and whispered 'Eric, sorry to bother you. There's a telephone call for you.' Lol jumped up and said 'That's the voice, her voice is perfect!'.\" The group agreed that Redfern was the ideal person, but Redfern was unconvinced and had to be coaxed into recording her vocal contribution, using the same whispered voice that she had used when entering the control room.

On the strength of that one song, we did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money.\" Despite impressing their new label with the track, Phonogram felt that it was not suitable for release as a single due to its length, and released \"Life Is a Minestrone\" as the first single from The Original Soundtrack instead.
