Cohee described himself as \"growling\" and making \"animalistic noises\" as he was stabbing Barnes. Cohee cut off Barnes's hands and head and put them in plastic bags, which he put in his car. Cohee drove them home and hid the bags, then cleaned the blood from his knife and car and went to sleep. Cohee compared himself to serial killer Edmund Kemper. Cohee confessed to traveling back to the crime scene, collecting the remaining body-parts, putting them in the trunk of his car, and dumping them in the Colorado River, flooding his car in the process.

The number of centenarians in relation to the total population was, in September 2010, 114% higher in Shimane Prefecture than the national average. This ratio was also 92% higher in Okinawa Prefecture. In Okinawa, studies have shown five factors that have contributed to the large number of centenarians in that region:",
