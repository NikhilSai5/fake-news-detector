In \"I Know Places\", which is instrumented by sparse piano, stuttering vocals, and drum-and-bass beats, the narrator vows to protect a fragile love, comparing herself and her partner to animals being hunted down. Swift was inspired to write the standard album's closing track \"Clean\" after spending two weeks in London and realizing that she no longer missed an ex-boyfriend who lived there. With a sparse, minimalist arrangement, the track details the narrator's journey towards recovery after a heartbreak: she compares getting over a broken relationship to an addiction that leaves her in deep pain, to the point that healing makes little sense, and after a destructive yet transformative torrential storm, the narrator becomes \"finally clean\".",

While the couple fantasizes about staying in their \"Wonderland\" forever, this relationship's ending is foreshadowed by their curiosity and others' scrutiny on them. The aggressive bass drum instrumentation of \"Wonderland\" evokes hip-hop and alternative rock. Inspired by Antonoff and Lena Dunham's relationship, the ballad \"You Are in Love\" recounts the ups and downs of a stable relationship through mundane daily activities over a soft electropop production. \"New Romantics\", whose title references the New Romantic cultural movement of the 1970s and 1980s decades, finds Swift's narrator reclaiming her broken heart and celebrating the pain that she has endured with a euphoric new wave, synth-pop, and indie electronic sound.",

Maryn Wilkinson, a scholar in media studies, described Swift's 1989 persona as \"zany\": she deliberately showcased that her \"pop\" persona was a construct of hard work, implying that her \"real\" persona existed beneath her \"pop\" performances in videos and interviews. In doing so, Swift reminded her audience that she still retained her authentic self from her country beginnings. Wilkinson considered Swift's \"zany\" persona a means for her to both abandon country for pop, and retain fans from her country days, while Randy Lewis of the Los Angeles Times thought that she did so via the intimate bonds with fans thanks to her social media usage and the \"Secret Sessions\".",

For Perone, these voice memos personalized 1989 by providing an insider's view of her creative process. According to Myles McNutt, a scholar in communications and the arts, Swift used the voice memos to claim authorship of 1989, defying pop music's \"gendered hierarchy\" which had seen a dominance of male songwriters and producers.
