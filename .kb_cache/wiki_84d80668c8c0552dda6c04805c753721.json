    "text": "The film was rejected by the British Board of Film Classification in 1957. United Artists released the film worldwide the next month. The film's release was not wide, and it played mostly in drive-ins. However, it did gross $1,000,000 for United Artists. When Alfred Hitchcock saw the film, he was apparently impressed enough to give Altman a job directing episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which led to more television work for Altman over the next decade.",

He then produced a delinquency film in Hollywood, Daddy-O, but his mini-mogul reign was short-lived. An alcoholic who drank heavily, he died in 1959 at the age of 37 three months after suffering a heart attack.",
