The Palestinian Authority controlled the Gaza Strip prior to the Palestinian elections of 2006 and the subsequent Gaza conflict between the Fatah and Hamas parties, when it lost control to Hamas; the PA continues to claim the Gaza Strip, although Hamas exercises de facto control. Since January 2013, following United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19, the Palestinian Authority has used the name \"State of Palestine\" on official documents, without prejudice to the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) role as \"representative of the Palestinian people\".",

Further negotiations were then meant to take place between the two parties regarding its final status. According to the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority was designated to have exclusive control over both security-related and civilian issues in Palestinian urban areas (referred to as \"Area A\") and only civilian control over Palestinian rural areas (\"Area B\"). The remainder of the territories, including Israeli settlements, the Jordan Valley region and bypass roads between Palestinian communities, were to remain under Israeli control (\"Area C\"). East Jerusalem was excluded from the Accords. Negotiations with several Israeli governments had resulted in the Authority gaining further control of some areas, but control was then lost in some areas when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retook several strategic positions during the Second (\"Al-Aqsa\") Intifada. In 2005, after the Second Intifada, Israel withdrew unilaterally from its settlements in the Gaza Strip, thereby expanding Palestinian Authority control to the entire strip while Israel continued to control the crossing points, airspace, and the waters of the Gaza Strip's coast.",

    "text": "The Biden administration resumed payments to the PA that have been used towards \"pay to slay.\" Many commentators have also advised that any future payments to the PLO be conditioned on the complete cessation of funds going towards payments to murderers of Israeli or American civilians. A lawsuit against Joe Biden and Antony Blinken was filed stating that the United States government funding such \"pay to slay\" terrorism is a violation of the Taylor Force Act passed in 2018 during the Trump administration. Some commentators allege that the Biden administration may circumvent the Taylor Force Act by merely claiming that the funds are being made in support of Palestinian \"humanitarian aims.\" Critics argue that by claiming to give funds in support of \"humanitarian assistance\" the Biden administration is claiming a loophole that does not exist, and that the funds may still be redirected with ease towards \"pay to slay\" ends. Numerous commentators criticize how easily the PA is able to re-direct American funds once received from the United States, towards \"pay to slay\" programs. Also, critics allege that it is unlikely that the PA is going to use all of the money received from the American government for strictly \"humanitarian\" purposes, on the basis that the majority of funds within the PA budget already as of 2023 go towards \"pay to slay\" and not \"other welfare programs\", as reported by The Jerusalem Post: \"The perverse incentive used by the PA is that the more gruesome and worse the attack, the more money the imprisoned 'martyr' and his family receive through the Palestinian Authority\u2019s Martyrs Fund. The PA spends nearly $350 million per year on 'pay for slay', but just $220 million for its other welfare programs for the rest of its citizens.\"",
