The attackers, armed with M4 carbines and AK-47s, entered the Baisaran Valley, a famous tourist spot, through the surrounding forests. This incident is considered the deadliest attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.",

Also related is the issuance of domicile status to residents who did not qualify earlier as 'state-subjects', qualifying them for jobs and college seats. While fears have been expressed that these changes would result in a change in demographics in Kashmir, with non-locals settling in the area, critics of the earlier arrangement noted that it had created a legal asymmetry: people from Jammu and Kashmir had always been free to settle anywhere in India, but in Jammu and Kashmir people from elsewhere were barred from permanent residency, property ownership, and government jobs. This disparity was cited as discriminatory by proponents of the constitutional changes, who also noted that the previous laws discriminated against women from within the region by revoking their property rights if they married a non-permanent resident.",

Simultaneously, it accused India of exacerbating regional tensions. Pakistan's call for an unbiased inquiry received backing from Turkey, China, Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim,  Switzerland and Greece. However, India categorically rejected the proposal, dismissing the notion of an independent investigation. Meanwhile, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in India which sought a judicial investigation. The Supreme Court justice Surya Kant rejected the calls, stating that the court's role was to decide disputes, not to conduct investigations. Independently, investigative journalists from ThePrint found that the demand for the high-resolution satellite imagery of Pahalgam area surged at Maxar two months before the Pahalgam attack. The period of the surge coincided with the joining of a Pakistani geospatial firm, Business Systems International (BSI), as a 'partner' with Maxar. The firm's owner Obaidullah Syed was previously convicted for illegally exporting computer equipment and software to Pakistani government agencies.",
