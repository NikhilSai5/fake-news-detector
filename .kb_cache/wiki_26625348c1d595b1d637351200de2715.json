Ralph is content with their life, but Vanellope longs for excitement and expresses how bored she has become of Sugar Rush's predictability. To please her, Ralph sneaks into her game and makes a secret road. The next day, when Vanellope fights the arcade player's control to test the track, the cabinet's steering wheel breaks. As the company that made Sugar Rush is out of business, and the cost of a replacement wheel on eBay is expensive, Litwak decides to scrap Sugar Rush and unplugs the game, leaving its citizens homeless. The Surge Protector finds refuge for all Sugar Rush's citizens as a short-term measure as they figure out how to save the game, with Felix and Calhoun adopting the racers. Remembering eBay, Ralph and Vanellope travel through Litwak's new Wi-Fi router to the Internet, a place where websites are represented as buildings in a sprawling city, avatars represent users, and programs are people.",

She directs them to BuzzzTube's head algorithm, Yesss, who capitalizes on Ralph's video popularity.

Vanellope offers to help advertise the videos, and Ralph has Yesss send her to Oh My Disney. There, while being chased by Stormtroopers for unauthorized advertising, Vanellope befriends the Disney Princesses, being encouraged by them to discuss her sense of un-fulfillment and reaching an epiphany in the form of an \"I Want\" song on the subject. Meanwhile, Ralph makes enough money to buy the wheel but finds Vanellope talking with Shank, overhearing how she wants to stay in Slaughter Race, having felt at home there due to its relative novelty and unpredictability compared to Sugar Rush.",

Brian Lowry of CNN said that \"The colorful action should delight tykes, but the smart, media-savvy asides make it especially appealing to grownups\". Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying \"what makes the movie compelling, despite the subdued dramatic payoff, is that it is a heightened reflection of our experience\u2014our love affair, really\u2014with our gadgets, our apps and, yes, our brands\". Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three stars out of four, stating that the film is \"almost always inspired in the moment\" and said that \"the new characters are all pretty great\", though he said that the film's first third \"struggles to find its focus\", and felt that Felix and Calhoun's subplot \"would have worked better as a pre-movie animated short\". Chris Bumbray of JoBlo's Movie Emporium said that the film \"is just as solid\" as the first film, and said it was compared to the science fiction film Ready Player One. Bryan Bishop of The Verge described the film as \"The Lego Movie of Disney films\", stating that it \"soars when it sends up the studio's own films, but its portrayal of the internet feels a little optimistic for 2018.\"",

Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said that \"Within a few years, the specifics of the viral-video gags in Ralph Breaks the Internet will be as dated as a Tay Zonday joke\".

Vanellope is a glitch within the game who wants to become a playable character, and Ralph helps her along, forming a bond between them. Felix and Calhoun team up to find Ralph before Fix-It Felix, Jr. is to be unplugged, and before the Cy-Bug can reproduce in Sugar Rush and destroy the game. Ralph discovers that the population of Sugar Rush has been suppressed by King Candy, who is really Turbo; not only had he managed to escape into Sugar Rush, but also rewrote part of Vanellope's code, displacing her as the game's main character. Ralph, Vanellope, Felix, and Calhoun work together and defeat Turbo and the Cy-Bugs, saving both Sugar Rush and the arcade and later sparing Fix-It Felix, Jr. from being unplugged. Ralph is finally recognized as a hero, and happily returns to his duties in his game, while Vanellope enjoys her new popularity among the arcade players.",

Ralph and Vanellope learn of a replacement wheel from eBay, and use a new Internet router in the arcade to travel to the Internet to get it, while the recently married Felix and Calhoun stay to make sure the Sugar Rush characters have a temporary home. Ralph and Vanellope successfully win the auction but do not have the funds to get it, and look for job opportunities. When Ralph finds a way to earn all the funds by becoming a viral video star with the help of Yesss, he discovers that Vanellope may want to stay in the gritty racing game Slaughter Race and not return to the arcade thanks to Shank, a character from that game. This prompts Ralph to use a dark web virus to shut down the game and save Vanellope, only for the virus to turn on Ralph's own insecure feelings and start propagating through the Internet and destroying it. Ralph, Vanellope, and their newfound allies are able to stop the virus in time thanks to the power of Ralph and Vanellope's rekindled friendship. The two say their goodbyes and Ralph returns to the arcade just as Sugar Rush is plugged back in. The two keep in contact, however.",
