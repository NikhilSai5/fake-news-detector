As a result of this visit, the developers came to the conclusion that each Buk transporter erector launcher (TEL) should have its own fire control radar, rather than being reliant on one central radar for the whole system as in Kub.

Specifications include a maximum target speed of 3,000 m/s (11,000 km/h; 6,700 mph; Mach 8.8), an altitude range of 0.015\u201335 km (49\u2013114,829 ft) and a distance range of 2.5\u201370 km (1.6\u201343.5 mi). Extensive trials began in 2015, with the first deliveries planned for 2016. (2 in 2016). The probability of hitting a target with one missile is: aircraft \u2013 0.95; tactical ballistic missile \u2013 0.7; cruise missile \u2013 0.8. It offers increased efficiency against electronic countermeasures and manoeuvring targets. They are more compact, increasing the TELAR's carrying capacity to six missiles. The missile's new HE-fragmentation warhead can more easily penetrate armor. The complex is highly mobile and designed against air, ground and sea targets (e.g. destroyers).",
