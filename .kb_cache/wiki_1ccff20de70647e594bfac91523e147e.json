Bol\u00edvar was educated abroad and lived in Spain, as was common for men of upper-class families in his day. While living in Madrid from 1800 to 1802, he was introduced to Enlightenment philosophy and married Mar\u00eda Teresa Rodr\u00edguez del Toro y Alaysa, who died in Venezuela from yellow fever in 1803. From 1803 to 1805, Bol\u00edvar embarked on a Grand Tour that ended in Rome, where he swore to end the Spanish rule in the Americas. In 1807, Bol\u00edvar returned to Venezuela and promoted Venezuelan independence to other wealthy creoles. When the Spanish authority in the Americas weakened due to Napoleon's Peninsular War, Bol\u00edvar became a zealous combatant and politician in the Spanish-American wars of independence.",

In January 2008, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez set up a commission to investigate his claim that Bol\u00edvar had been poisoned by \"New Granada traitors.\" The commission exhumed Bol\u00edvar's remains on 16 July 2010. The results, made public on 26 July 2011, were inconclusive; Vice President of Venezuela El\u00edas Jaua announced that the commission could not prove Ch\u00e1vez's claim. Ch\u00e1vez continued to claim that Bol\u00edvar had been assassinated via arsenic poisoning, citing a paper by infectious disease specialist Paul Auwaerter. Following Ch\u00e1vez's remarks, Auwaerter stated that the arsenic likely came from medicines Bol\u00edvar had ingested to treat his illnesses.",

The tutelage of Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, a student of Rousseau, has been traditionally seen as foundational for Bol\u00edvar's beliefs. Also important to Bol\u00edvar's intellectual development were his stays in Paris from 1804 to 1806 and in London in 1810. Bol\u00edvar was an Anglophile, and sought British aid in securing Latin American independence. The extent of Bol\u00edvar's religiosity is debated; while Bol\u00edvar resented the social capital of the Catholic Church and its Royalist leanings during the wars of independence, he sought to co-opt its social capital for the benefit of the republics he established rather than dismember the Church.",

By the 1820s, his goal was to create a federation of Latin American republics in Spanish America, each governed by a strong executive and a constitution modeled on the British constitution. Inspired by Montesquieu, Bol\u00edvar believed that a government should conform to the needs and character of its region and inhabitants; in the Cartagena Manifesto, Bol\u00edvar stated that federalism as practiced in the United States was the \"perfect\" government but was unworkable in Spanish America because, he believed, Spanish imperialism had left Spanish Americans unprepared for federalism. Bol\u00edvar sought to prepare Colombia for a more liberal democracy via free, public education. Over the 1820s, Bol\u00edvar became increasingly disillusioned and authoritarian until, in 1830, he declared to Flores, \"all who have served the Revolution have plowed the sea.\"",

Days later on 11 December, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who had been ruling by decree wrote into law that the Bs.F 100 would be pulled from circulation within 72 hours because \"mafias\" were allegedly storing those particular notes to \"destabilize\" the economy. With more than 6 billion Bs.F 100 notes issued consisting of 46% of Venezuela's issued currency, Maduro enacted an exchange for Venezuelan citizens to transfer all Bs.F 100 notes for Bs.F 100 coins while also blocking international travel to prevent the return of the bol\u00edvares that were supposedly stockpiled. The government justified the move claiming that the United States was working with crime syndicates to spirit away Venezuela's paper money to warehouses in Europe to cause the fall of the government. The government was thwarting this threat by withdrawing the notes from circulation. On 14 February 2017, Paraguayan authorities uncovered a 30-tonne stash of Bs.F 50 and Bs.F 100 notes totaling Bs.F 1.5 billion on its Brazilian border that had not yet been circulated. According to a United States Department of Defense adviser linked to The Pentagon, the Bs.F 1.5 billion was printed by Venezuela and destined for Bolivia, since unlike the implied exchange rate of thousands of hard bol\u00edvares equaling one United States dollar, the exchange rate was approximately 10 hard bol\u00edvares per dollar, making the value of the stash 419 times stronger, from US$358,000 to US$150 million. The Pentagon adviser further stated that the Venezuelan government tried to send the newly printed notes to be exchanged by the Bolivian government so Bolivia could pay 20% of its debt to Venezuela, and so Venezuela could use the US dollars for its own disposal.",
