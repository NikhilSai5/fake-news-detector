In 2016, Bettencourt told Billboard: \"'Our label at the time [A&M Records] didn't want to release \"More Than Words\" as a single because there was nothing on the radio like that at the time. The label said, \"Who's going to play it?\" Everybody was doing big power ballads at the time, and this was more like an Everly Brothers or Beatles track. But we fought for it'\".",

As the nineties went on, however, we really started to resent the song. We were tagged 'the More Than Words guys'. We didn't like the perception the song created about the band. I remember being on tour with Aerosmith in Poland... it was on that tour we decided we would not play the song. We just didn't do it. A couple nights into the tour, Steven Tyler writes in big letters on our dressing room door, 'Play the fucking song!' His attitude was almost father-like. He was like, 'Look, this is your first time in Poland. When do you think you will be back? They want to hear it, so play it!'\"",

Billik from Associated Press described \"More Than Words\" as a \"sweet, pure acoustic ballad\", \"whose message is that the words 'I love you' are becoming meaningless\". The song was also labeled as a \"nontraditional love song\". Larry Flick from Billboard magazine felt this \"tender, sparsely produced rock/love ballad proves that sometimes less really is more. The spotlight here is on the band's striking vocal harmonies, as well as its shimmering acoustic guitar work\". The Daily Vault's Sean McCarthy called it a \"beautiful, minimal acoustic number [that] made the band huge\" and concluded that \"for the band, 'More Than Words' is the song that will still get airplay.\" Diane Cardwell from Entertainment Weekly called it \"a simple, almost folkie ballad using just two voices and a single acoustic guitar.\" Kirsten Frickle from El Paisano described it as an \"all-acoustic ballad that is so beautiful it will make your hair stand on end\".",

And it must be said, they handle this ballad extremely well.\" Alan Jones from Music Week named it Pick of the Week, remarking that it is \"a subdued, lilting acoustic workout that suggests nothing more than Simon & Garfunkel in its more angelic passages.\" Carrie Borzillo from Record-Journal called it an \"Everly Brothers-style\" song. A reviewer from Sandwell Evening Mail wrote, \"If ever a song could be unrepresentative of a band's output, Extreme's worldwide smash hit ballad 'More Than Words' is it.\" Marc Andrews from Smash Hits found it \"eye-moistening\". Tom Nordlie from Spin viewed it as \"a love ballad that sounds like the Everly Brothers or early Beatles.\" He added, \"Singer Gary Cherone harmonizes with himself as guitar-friend Nuno Bettencourt strums clean, jazzy chord accompaniment, and that's it. No sudden escalation to bombast in the middle, no reneging on the song's original promise.\" Chad Bowar writing for LiveAbout placed the song on his list of the \"Best 20 Hair Metal Ballads of the '80s and '90s\".",
