The magazine included fashion advice. Anthony Overton founded the magazine. Despite Overton's role, Katherine E. Williams, who became Katherine Williams-Irvin, was listed as its owner and editor-in-chief. Overton advertised his company's beauty products line in the magazine. It was originally aimed at an audience of both women and men, but shifted its aim to women around 1918.",

    "text": "Sabato grew up in Norfolk, Virginia, graduating from Norfolk Catholic High School in 1970. Sabato is of Italian heritage. Sabato graduated from the University of Virginia in 1974. A 1974 Cavalier Daily poll showed more people could identify Sabato as student government president than could name Edgar F. Shannon Jr. as University president. Sabato graduated Phi Beta Kappa as a Government major. He followed his undergraduate degree with graduate study at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs for one year. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1975, which brought him to study at Queen's College, Oxford. In less than two years he earned his doctorate in politics from Oxford. Prior to his time as a political analyst, Sabato worked for nine years with Virginia Democratic Party politician Henry Howell. At the age of 15, Sabato joined Howell's first campaign for the Virginia governorship in 1968, and then worked on his successful run for lieutenant governor in 1971, and his campaigns for governor in 1973 and 1977.",

In 2004, when Republicans retained the White House and gained seats in the House and Senate, Crystal Ball correctly predicted the outcome of 525 of the 530 political races (99% accuracy), missing only one House race, one Senate race, one governor's race, and two states in the Electoral College. In August 2006, Crystal Ball predicted that the Democrats would gain 29 seats in the House of Representatives and 6 seats in the Senate, providing them with a majority in both chambers. Sabato's predictions proved correct: each of his 33 Senate predictions were accurate, and in the House, Democrats gained 29 seats on election night, the precise total predicted by Crystal Ball (Democrats went on to pick up a 30th seat in the December 12, 2006, runoff in Texas' 23rd district).",

He was also the only national analyst who correctly predicted the exact Democratic gains in Senate and House contests. In July 2008, Crystal Ball correctly projected that Barack Obama would win the presidency in a near-landslide. Sabato predicted a 364\u2013174 margin in the Electoral College, as well as the popular vote percentages. The prediction was merely one point off the mark, with the actual result on November 4, 2008, being Obama 365 to McCain 173. It did not predict an Obama win in Nebraska's 2nd district, as he did not make separate predictions for individual congressional districts in states that split their electoral votes on such factors (he started making separate predictions for such districts in 2012, probably because of this occurrence). Crystal Ball also accurately predicted 34 of all 35 Senate races, and 11 gubernatorial races correctly.",

It predicted a pickup of 8 seats in the Senate for Republicans, later the Republicans picked up 6 Senate seats. In 2012, Crystal Ball projected that Obama would win the presidency with 290 electoral votes to 248 for Romney; there would be no change in partisan makeup of the Senate, with Democrats at 53 and Republicans at 47; and Democrats would pick up 3 seats in the House of Representatives, for a result of 239 Republicans and 196 Democrats. The projection was similar to the actual results but Crystal Ball underestimated Obama's number of electoral votes (332) and underestimated Democratic victories in both the Senate (Democrats picked up two seats) and in the House (Democrats picked up eight seats).",

Biden ended up winning 306 to Trump's 232, with North Carolina (15 electoral votes) being Crystal Ball's only incorrectly predicted state.
