Mild cases are usually successfully treated with conservative measures such as hospitalization with intravenous fluid infusion, pain control, and early enteral feeding. If a person is not able to tolerate feeding by mouth, feeding via nasogastric or nasojejunal tubes are frequently used which provide nutrition directly to the stomach or intestines respectively. Severe cases often require admission to an intensive care unit. Severe pancreatitis, which by definition includes organ damage other than the pancreas, is associated with a mortality rate of 20%. The condition is characterized by the pancreas secreting active enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase, instead of their inactive forms, leading to auto-digestion of the pancreas. Calcium helps to convert trypsinogen to the active trypsin, thus elevated calcium (of any cause) is a potential cause of pancreatitis. Damage to the pancreatic ducts can occur as a result of this. Long term complications include type 3c diabetes (pancreatogenic diabetes), in which the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin due to structural damage. 35% develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in which the pancreas is unable to secrete digestive enzymes due to structural damage, leading to malabsorption.",

    "text": "Acute pancreatitis occurs when there is abnormal activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreas. This occurs through inappropriate activation of inactive enzyme precursors called zymogens (or proenzymes) inside the pancreas, most notably trypsinogen. Normally, trypsinogen is converted to its active form (trypsin) in the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), where the enzyme assists in the digestion of proteins. During an episode of acute pancreatitis, trypsinogen comes into contact with lysosomal enzymes (specifically cathepsin), which activate trypsinogen to trypsin. The active form trypsin then leads to further activation of other molecules of trypsinogen. The activation of these digestive enzymes lead to inflammation, edema, vascular injury, and even cellular death. The death of pancreatic cells occurs via two main mechanisms: apoptosis, which is physiologically controlled, and necrosis, which is less organized and more damaging. The balance between these two mechanisms of cellular death is mediated by caspases which regulate apoptosis and have important anti-necrosis functions during pancreatitis: preventing trypsinogen activation, preventing ATP depletion through inhibiting polyADP-ribose polymerase, and by inhibiting the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). If, however, the caspases are depleted due to either chronic ethanol exposure or through a severe insult then necrosis can predominate.",
