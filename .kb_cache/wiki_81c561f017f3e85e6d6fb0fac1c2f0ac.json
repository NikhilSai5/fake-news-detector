The BB-1 was introduced and later adopted by the Soviet Air Forces in the same year. A year later, the BB-1 was later designated the Sukhoi Su-2. A total of 910 Su-2 aircraft were built. The resolution also made Sukhoi chief designer, gave Sukhoi's team of the design bureau standalone status and relocation of the bureau to the Production Aircraft Plant No. 135 in Kharkiv, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, Sukhoi was not satisfied with its location, since it was isolated from the scientific pole of Moscow. Sukhoi later relocated the bureau to the aerodrome of Moscow Oblast, completing half of the relocation by 1940.

The nose antenna is tilted backwards for stealth. Moreover, the side-looking radar could enable the Su-57 to employ beaming tactics while still able to guide its own missile. The suite also has two N036L-1-01 L band transceivers on the wing's leading edge flaps that are not only used to handle the N036Sh Pokosnik (Reaper) friend-or-foe identification (IFF) system but also for electronic warfare purposes. Processing of the X- and L-band signals by the N036YeVS and GRPZ Solo-21 computers enable the system's information to be significantly enhanced. The L402 Himalayas ECM suite made by the Kaluga Research Radio Engineering Institute uses both its own arrays and the N036 radar system, with one of its arrays mounted in the dorsal sting between the two engines. Redundant radio telephone communication and encrypted data exchange among various aircraft and also command centers (ground and sea-based and airborne) are provided by the S-111 system, developed by Polyot.",

The aircraft is capable of deploying countermeasures such as flares and radar decoys, as well as single-use programmable ECM transmitters.

    "text": "On 10 June 2014, the fifth flying prototype, aircraft T-50-5, was severely damaged by an engine fire after landing. The pilot managed to escape unharmed. The aircraft was subsequently written off, and its salvageable parts were cannibalized to finish the sixth \"first stage\" prototype, which was then given the fifth prototype's bort number and its designation changed from T-50-6-1 to T-50-5R. However, official accounting still considers the two aircraft to be the \"same\" one.",

The pilot ejected and was recovered by helicopter. According to TASS, the test flight took place at an altitude of 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) when the malfunction occurred, causing the airplane to enter a rapid spiral descent. When all attempts to stabilize the airplane into a horizontal flight using the manual flight control system failed, the pilot ejected at an altitude of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft).",
