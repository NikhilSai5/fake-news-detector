They were among the few journalists, and, according to the AP, the only international journalists in Mariupol during that period, and their photographs were extensively used by Western media to cover the siege and the situation in the city. According to Chernov, on 11 March, they were in a hospital taking photos, when they were evacuated from the city with the assistance of Ukrainian soldiers. They managed to escape from Mariupol unharmed, at which point, he said, no journalists were left in the city.",

In March 2023, during a visit to the city by president Putin, Marat Khusnullin assured that Russian forces did not use artillery fire against residential buildings during their advance on Mariupol, while accusing Ukrainian forces of destruction during their retreat. Previously, a number of videos from during the siege, showed Russian tanks firing at residential buildings. On the same day as Putin talked to Khusnullin, Russian Izvestya published an interview with a commander of a Russian 2S4 \"Tyulpan\" mortar battery who described that their mortars were so powerful that they were able to collapse nine-story multi-apartment blocks specifically during the siege of Mariupol.",

No electricity or water. Russian tanks roaming the streets. Nights punctuated by shelling.\" Ukrainian officials warned that this battle risked \"becoming a second Aleppo.\" The Syria Civil Defense team said \"They want to empty those cities of their population, so it will be less costly for Russia to take over,\" and indeed some estimates were that 75% of Mariupol's population had left by 31 March.",
