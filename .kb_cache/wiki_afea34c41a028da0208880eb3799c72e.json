    "text": "President Trump issued Executive Order 14157, titled \"Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists\". As the name suggests, this executive order designates certain international cartels and organizations as terrorist organizations. Specifically, the executive order lists the Tren de Aragua cartel, the La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) cartel, and the Mexican cartels. Trump claims these organizations pose an economic and national security threat and thereby declares a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Declaring a national emergency under this act grants the President certain powers and authority to be able to deal with this threat, such as ordering all cartel members to be removed from the United States. Designating them as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring a national emergency allows Trump to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which is a wartime law. This law gives the President wartime authority to deport those deemed enemies, and allows deportations done under it to proceed without going through the immigration court system.  In other words, this makes those labeled as terrorists subject to expedited removal and will speed up the process by which these deportations can take place. Nonetheless, some legal experts claim it might be difficult for Trump to invoke this law as it is meant only for when the U.S. is at war or when another nation has threatened to invade, and neither of those are occurring. On the other hand, other experts believe the law is broad enough to allow Trump to invoke it, despite the U.S. not being at war.",

The children's mother was not permitted to speak with an attorney or family members prior to their deportation, despite trying to do so. ICE agents then demanded that RMZ sign a document without explanation of what it said and without allowing her to talk to her lawyer about it, which she refused to do. ICE agents informed them that they would be deported, refused a request to talk to their lawyer and then allowed them a brief call to the father to inform him they were being deported. They were taken out through the back, to avoid their lawyer, and driven 3 hours to a hotel in Alexandria. Later, their lawyer was informed that they had been transferred, but gave no further information. The lawyer was told to take the matter up with an office in New Orleans, which they did - filing a stay of removal and pointing out that they were not properly notified which should result in an automatic stay. The lawyer then asked to talk to a supervisor but was told no one was available. The lawyer spent much of the day trying to identify the location of RMZ and her children and to make arrangement for the children prior to deportation, but was unable to get responses to her requests. That night RMZ was able to make a brief call on an ICE agent's phone to her father and tell him they were in Alexandria and were to be deported the next day, but then the agent hung up the phone.",

Legal advisors have begun warning citizens in spite of this to consider carrying documents for their own safety, due to documented and ongoing incidents of ICE detaining U.S. citizens. Naturalized citizens also began to warn each other and their communities to carry paper proof of who they are as self-defense against ICE.

She still believed that after hearing of others approached by ICE, taken, detained and deported. But when her white, native-born American husband in law enforcement urged her and their daughters to carry proof, she realized it was no longer happening somewhere else. While a Real ID compliant form of identification is required for domestic air travel, there is no law or legal requirement for U.S. citizens to carry proof of citizenship within the country. Historians have contrasted the ongoing crisis of detained American citizens to World War II concentration camps, including Manzanar.
