The decision to use real water to depict the flooding was made due to financial restrictions on using high-quality graphics. They began building miniature houses to show water rushing into the houses and raising water levels. The major shots of the flood were done on a 22-acre film set site at Maravanthuruthu near Vaikom. A 2 acre water tank was constructed on the set, filled with water and underwater sequences were shot. 14 houses were built in total, which were then transformed into different houses as per need. Electric posts, plants, and trees were made up of water-resistant materials.
