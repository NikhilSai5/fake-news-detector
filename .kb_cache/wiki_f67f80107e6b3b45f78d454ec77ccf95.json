The vast Lake Peipus in the east washes the Livonian province for over 110 versts (117 km); in the center of the province is the great inland basin of V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv; followed by the considerable lakes Burtnieks, Lub\u0101ns, Lake Al\u016bksne, etc. - All these lakes are of little commercial and industrial importance for the gubernia so far (except for fishing), but they can be combined into a whole system of water communications, the projects of which have already arisen more than once. On the coastal strip of the Livonian gubernia the Gulf of Riga forms two harbors, accessible to large ships, although the entrance to them is hampered by bars and the tortuosity of the fairway. These harbors are Riga harbor at the mouth of the Daugava River and P\u00e4rnu harbor at the mouth of the river of the same name. The Baltic Sea on the coasts of the Livonian islands is full of small harbors, but uncomfortable due to the shallow water and many reefs and shoals, except Ahrensburg, which is more convenient and has a good roadstead. The main islands that lie in the Baltic Sea and belong to the Livonian province (Saaremaa, Hiiumaa) are separated from the coast of the Estonian province by the big strait, or Moone-Sund, and from each other by the Small-Sund. The rivers of Livonia province belong to the basins of the Gulf of Riga and the Gulf of Finland. The former include the navigable Pernava with its tributaries Navast, Hallist and Reio; the Salis River, the outlet of Lake Burtnieks, into which the rivers R\u016bja and Seda; the Sv\u0113tupe River, which flows directly into the Gulf of Riga and is connected to the Salaca by the Neibach Channel. In addition, numerous lakes and coastal rivers 20\u201330 km long flow directly into the Gulf of Riga.
