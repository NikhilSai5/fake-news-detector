In terms of the non-tonal (i.e. phonemic) features, the nucleus vowel is the only required part of a licit syllable in Chinese varieties. Unlike Mandarin but like other southern varieties of Chinese, Taiwanese has final stop consonants with no audible release, a feature that has been preserved from Middle Chinese.

One employed was encoding the necessary characters in the \"Private Use\" section of Unicode, but this required both the writer and the reader to have the correct custom font installed. Another solution was to replace troublesome characters with near equivalents, for example substituting \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 for \u27e8\u0101\u27e9 or using a standard \u27e8o\u27e9 followed by an interpunct to represent \u27e8o\u0358\u27e9.

    "text": "One of the most popular modern ways of writing Taiwanese is by using a mixed orthography called H\u00e0n-l\u00f4 (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u7f57; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u7f85; pinyin: H\u00e0n-Lu\u00f3; lit. 'Chinese-Roman'), and sometimes Han-Romanization mixed script, a style not unlike written Japanese or (historically) Korean. In fact, the term H\u00e0n-l\u00f4 does not describe one specific system, but covers any kind of writing in Southern Min which features both Chinese characters and romanization. That romanization is usually POJ, although recently some texts have begun appearing with Taiwanese Romanization System (T\u00e2i-l\u00f4) spellings too. The problem with using only Chinese characters to write Southern Min is that there are many morphemes (estimated to be around 15 percent of running text) which are not definitively associated with a particular character. Various strategies have been developed to deal with the issue, including creating new characters, allocating Chinese characters used in written Mandarin with similar meanings (but dissimilar etymology) to represent the missing characters, or using romanization for the \"missing 15%\". There are two rationales for using mixed orthography writing, with two different aims. The first is to allow native speakers (almost all of whom can already write Chinese characters) to make use of their knowledge of characters, while replacing the missing 15% with romanization. The second is to wean character literates off using them gradually, to be replaced eventually by fully romanized text.",

Gallese legends frequently address recurring characters, such as Gargantua and Morgan le Fay, or questions of how the countryside was created. In the 19th century, oral literature was collected by researchers and folklorists such as Paul S\u00e9billot, Adolphe Orain, Amand Dagnet and Georges Dottin. However, these authors frequently rewrote this literature in French. Paul F\u00e9val wrote certain dialogues in Gallo in his novel Ch\u00e2teaupauvre (1876). Amand Dagnet (1857\u20131933) wrote a number of original works in Gallo, including a play La fille de la Brunelas (1901). In the 1920s, Jeanne Malivel wrote Les Sept Fr\u00e8res, a story which was inspired by her grandmother and was written in Gallo. This, in part, inspired the creation of the artistic movement Seiz Breur.",

Certain consonant combinations are also characteristic of certain regions, such as the plosives [c] and [\u025f], which can be compared to [k] or [g] followed by a light [j] sound. The affricates [d\u0292] and [t\u0283] appear in the western part of Haute-Bretagne, where, for example, the word cur\u00eb [ky\u0281e] is pronounced as [t\u0283y\u0281\u0259], and the word ghepe as [d\u0292ep]. Elsewhere, [cy\u0281\u0259] and [\u025f\u0259p] can be heard. Qhi, meanwhile, can be pronounced [ki], [t\u0283i] or [ci]. These modifications result from an advancement of the place of articulation of the palatal consonants. The semi-consonant [j] is used extensively to palatalize other consonants, notably [fj], [tj], [sj] and [pj]. However, this is not done in all regions, and [j] is often replaced by [l].

In most of Upper Brittany, it is a schwa, and elsewhere it is a [\u025b] or an [e] (the geographical distribution is the same as for [e]/[e\u02d0]). The Latin [o] in open stressed syllables became a ue, then monophthonged in both French and Gallo around the 12th century, becoming [\u0153] in French, [\u0259] in Gallo. C\u00f3r thus became qheur. The evolution of the Latin [e] in closed stressed syllables is much more diverse, and the original diphthong \u00e9i has been replaced by a large number of phonemes varying from word to word and region to region. The many pronunciations of mai, from the Latin m\u00e9, illustrate this diversity: [maj], [ma], [me], [m\u025b], etc. The pronunciation of Latin [o]/[u] in closed stressed syllables is more authentic in Gallo than in other langues d\u2019o\u00efl.
