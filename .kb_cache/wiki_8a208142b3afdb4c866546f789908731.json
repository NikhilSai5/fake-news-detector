Reviewing the album for Clash, Lauren Dehollogne wrote that Burns \"proves that she is willing to bare her soul while delivering some of the best pop vocals of the last decade\" as she is \"often conducting a sound that resembles the gap between early Beyonc\u00e9 and Paramore\" and \"able to make even her saddest moments danceable\". DIY's Bella Martin stated that \"when Early Twenties is as its best is when Cat is at her most inside-thoughts-out-loud, marrying the specificities of her internal struggles with conversely euphoric pop moments\".",

The project brims with honesty, practical wisdom, and reminders that we're more resilient than we think.\" He concluded that Early Twenties \"documents a young and talented artist striving to make herself a better human and the world a better place\". Tara Joshi of The Observer said, \"imbued with moving gospel richness and an indie sensibility, it's an introspective but anthemic, English-accented pop collection about growing pains\".",
