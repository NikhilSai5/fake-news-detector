    "text": "Since October 2022, following a TikTok trend, Hyundai vehicles especially in North America are highly targeted for theft due to their weaker security systems. Hyundai vehicles manufactured from 2016 to 2021 for the U.S. market that are not equipped with optional key fob and a push-button start mechanism lack immobilizers, a system that prevent the engine from being started unless a proper key is inserted. A video posted on TikTok depicted the theft process, which involves inserting a USB connector on a naked key slot and successfully starts a car. The vulnerability also affects vehicles produced by sister company Kia.",

    "text": "In 2022, Hyundai and its parts suppliers in the U.S. were discovered to be illegally employing child labor, primarily involving refugees from Central America. This issue involved parts suppliers, including Hyundai subsidiaries Hyundai Glovis and SMART, SL, Hwashin, and AJIN, many of which used temporary work agencies to recruit underage workers. These suppliers hired minors, some as young as 12, to operate heavy machinery, in direct violation of child labor laws. Following a Reuters report in July 2022, investigations confirmed these illegal practices, leading to fines and sanctions against several suppliers. In response to the scandal, Hyundai announced plans to divest its controlling stake in SMART.",
