At the time, he had never been charged with or convicted of a crime in either country; despite this, he was imprisoned without trial in the Salvadoran Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). His case became the most prominent of the hundreds of migrants the US sent to be jailed without trial at CECOT under the countries' agreement where the US would pay the Salvadoran government to imprison US deportees there. The administration defended the deportation and accused Garcia of being a member of MS-13\u2014a US-designated terrorist organization\u2014based on a determination made during a 2019 immigration court bail proceeding. Abrego Garcia has denied the allegation.",

In El Salvador, the Barrio 18 criminal gang extorted his mother's pupusa (a street food) business for money and threatened that if she did not pay the money, they would force her eldest son, Cesar, to join the gang; the gang later threatened to kill him. As a result, the family paid the money and hid Cesar, eventually sending him to the United States. Barrio 18 then turned its attention to Kilmar, who was around 12 years old. The gang followed Kilmar and continued to threaten his family. Eventually, when Kilmar was 16 years old, his family sent him to the US as well. Court documents indicate that around 2011 or 2012, he illegally crossed the Mexico\u2013US border near McAllen, Texas.

Her criteria were detaining civilians en masse without due process on basis of race, ethnicity, or supposed affiliation, as opposed to crimes; political ends to gather and keep power; typically open-ended detention so that a prison sentence, if any, may be honored or it may not; and an end run around the legal system, allowing detention not otherwise possible. Pitzer argued that Bukele's, and now Trump's, use of CECOT in their security theater met all of these criteria. She warned that those who open concentration camps seldom close them willingly; instead, extrajudicial detention can linger for decades and tends to expand its role, just as Auschwitz was a regular concentration camp for years before Birkenau was built, and Guantanamo Bay was an immigration detention facility to prevent refugees from getting asylum on American soil decades before it became a site for torture and indefinite detention.",
