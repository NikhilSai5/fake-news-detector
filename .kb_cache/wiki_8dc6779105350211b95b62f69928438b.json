The beginning of his term saw him extensively use executive orders and give increased authority to Elon Musk through the Department of Government Efficiency, leading to mass layoffs of the federal workforce and attempts to eliminate agencies such as USAID. These policies have drawn dozens of lawsuits that have challenged their legality. Trump's return to the presidency also saw the US increase enforcement against illegal immigration through the usage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as deportations, a general retreat from corporate America promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, increased support for Israel in the Gaza war in addition to direct airstrikes against Iran in June and fluctuating but high increases on tariffs across some of America's trading partners.  The Trump Administration worked for negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal. A formalized Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal was reached between Israel and Hamas.",

However, when the project was presented to several directors (including Robert Wise) and special effects teams (including Douglas Trumbull and Linwood Dunn), it was considered impossible to film due to the amount of effects work called for in the script, requiring filming technologies that did not exist at the time. The studio then brought in Alan Sharp to write a revised version to minimize this issue, which left out many of the elements of the original script and Zelazny's book.

The sequence involving giant 8-foot-long (2.4 m) scorpions attacking a motorcycle was attempted using full-scale scorpion props, but they did not work well, and the resulting footage was unacceptable. The solution was to use actual scorpions composited onto live action footage using the blue screen process in post-production. After the production moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, Jan-Michael Vincent became drunk, and insulted the local Native American residents, who in turn \"befriended\" him and gave him peyote, which caused a three-day delay in filming when Vincent became intoxicated, and could not be found. The action sequence with giant cockroaches used a combination of live Madagascar hissing cockroaches and large numbers of rubber bugs which looked unconvincing onscreen, as the strings pulling mats covered in fake insects were plainly visible. To complicate matters, according to director Jack Smight in his memoir, studio chief Alan Ladd, Jr. redirected about a quarter of Damnation Alley's total production budget as completion funds for George Lucas' lower-budgeted film, Star Wars. Smight was not made aware of the budget reduction on Damnation Alley until he neared its completion, which compromised most of the remaining special effects work, for which there was now very little money left.",

While the effects were underway, the completion funds were diverted to Star Wars, which was having budget and production issues, which eliminated several important effects scenes which had not yet been created, including the Minuteman III missile launch sequences, the base explosion, and importantly, the storm and tsunami in the last act.

This pushed the release date from December, 1976 to March, 1977, and then again to June, 1977.

In a panic, the release date was delayed to December, 1977, only to be moved up to October when the studio realized it would go up against the release of an expected hit, Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. With the additional delay, Fox re-edited the entire film. Smight was already involved with another project during this time, so Fox took over the re-edit. The decision was made to cut down the length of the film to the bare-minimum running time of 90 minutes for a theatrical release, and large sections of the film were edited out by the studio. These cuts amounted to 44 minutes of footage, and included a major subplot of a love triangle between Tanner, Denton, and Janice. Many scenes early in the film at the missile base were excised as well - sequences which showed the breakdown of military order. Murray Hamilton was featured prominently in several scenes which were cut, as the now-despondent and alcoholic General in charge of the base (which rendered his character literally \"mute\" in the final film, with no lines of dialogue). Critically, a physical confrontation between Tanner and Denton after the death of Keegan by \"killer cockroaches\" was removed (in this scene, Tanner blames Denton for not saving his friend from death, and subsequently attempts to kill him). In spite of these major edits, Fox focused more content on the \"Landmaster\" vehicle, and the special effects, in direct response to Star Wars. The film underwent several name changes during this period, from the original \"Damnation Alley\" to \"Salvation Road,\" and then to \"Survival Run\" up until shortly before the release, when it was again renamed \"Damnation Alley\".",
