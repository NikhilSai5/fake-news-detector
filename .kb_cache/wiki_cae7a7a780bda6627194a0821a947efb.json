The soap is one of the longest-running scripted television programs in the world, airing nearly every weekday since November 8, 1965. A co-production of Corday Productions and Sony Pictures Television, the series was created by husband-and-wife team Ted Corday and Betty Corday. During Days of Our Lives' early years, Irna Phillips (creator of former NBC stablemate Another World as well as its former CBS rivals, As the World Turns and Guiding Light) served as a story editor for the program and many of the show's earliest storylines were written by William J. Bell, who would depart the series in 1975 to focus full-time on The Young and the Restless, which he created for CBS in 1973. Following the 2007 cancellation of Passions, Days of Our Lives remained the only soap opera airing on NBC. On August 3, 2022, NBCUniversal announced that it would relocate the series exclusively to its Peacock streaming service beginning September 12, after 57 years on the network, leaving NBC as the only Big Three network without a daytime serial.",

Over time, additional families were brought into the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch Dr. Tom Horton and his wife, homemaker Alice, the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of Mickey Horton's wife Laura by Mickey's brother Bill. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of Michael Horton (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plot line was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally Margaret Mason for many years, later Elaine Princi) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely Maggie Simmons (Suzanne Rogers), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson (Mark Tapscott) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the Nielsen daytime ratings. Another love triangle, between lounge singer Doug Williams, Tom and Alice's daughter Addie, and Addie's own daughter, Julie, proved to be popular around the same time. The storyline culminated in the death of Addie in 1974 and the marriage of Doug and Julie in 1976.",

Bell, started writing for Days of Our Lives in 1966 and continued with the show until 1975, two years after he had created his own successful soap, The Young and the Restless, for rival network CBS. He continued with the show as a storyline consultant until 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many changes to the head writer position occurred. In the early 1980s, Margaret DePriest helped stabilize the show with her serial killer storyline. Later head writers, such as Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina, and Leah Laiman, built on that stability and crafted storylines of their own, temporarily helping to bringing up the program's ratings. Many head writer changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and the role would not become stable again until James E. Reilly joined the show in that role in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years and featured several supernatural-themed plotlines (which would later become the centerpiece of fellow NBC soap Passions, when the Reilly-created series debuted in July 1999), was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as Sally Sussman Morina and Tom Langan, failed to keep the ratings success, and additional head writer turnovers continued until Reilly \u2013 who would continue in his role as head writer and consulting producer of Passions after rejoining Days \u2013 returned to the series in 2003.",

By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against All My Children and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00 p.m./12 Noon timeslot. In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4:00 p.m./3:00 slot, the offerings of which many (if not most) of the network's stations had been preempting for years anyway.

Following the end of Sunset Beach on Channel 5 in 2000, they bought Days of our Lives as its replacement, however, it didn't catch on, and was cancelled after a year.

At intermission (between 1975 and 2011), Carey also voiced the show's mid-program bumper \u2013 which usually preceded a network promo that led into the local ad breaks during the fourth commercial break of each episode \u2013 reading, \"We will return for the second half of Days of Our Lives in just a moment.\"",

    "text": "The light orchestral theme music that accompanies the opening titles was composed by Charles Albertine, Tommy Boyce, and Bobby Hart, and was the first soap opera theme to be performed by an orchestral ensemble. Boyce and Hart were tasked by Ted and Betty Corday to create a theme for the show that sounded similar to \"Sunrise, Sunset,\" which the Cordays had recently heard while seeing the Broadway version of Fiddler on the Roof. After the Cordays approved their third submission, reminiscent of organ music Hart remembered hearing when his mother listened to radio soaps, Albertine was brought in to write the orchestration for the piece, adding a flute-and-bells broken arpeggio borrowed from his 1952 piece \"Music for Barefoot Ballerinas\", and a bridge section for the extended theme music. The theme has only been updated twice: in 1993, when a more conventional orchestral arrangement of the instrumental theme (arranged by musical director Steven Reinhardt) debuted with the introduction of the CGI sequence, and in May 2004, when a grander orchestration was introduced, coincident with the revelation that the characters thought to have been killed by the Salem Stalker had actually been carried off to the island of Melaswen. This version was only used in eight episodes, before reverting to the 1993 arrangement that has remained in use ever since. In June 2009, the instrumental theme was abbreviated to allow extra airtime for the episodic plot, shortening it from 32 to 17 seconds and commencing from the orchestral flourish.",

Incidentally, Friends co-lead actress Jennifer Aniston (who played Rachel Green in the series) is the daughter of John Aniston, who portrayed Victor Kiriakis on Days of Our Lives from 1985 until his death in 2022.

Studios, where Friends was filmed). Subsequent episodes featured pseudo-Days of Our Lives storylines invented for the sitcom, and included some guest appearances by real-life cast members from the soap opera.
