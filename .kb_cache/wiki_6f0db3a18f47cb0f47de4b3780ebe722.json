It is located in the Tababela parish, about 18 kilometres (11 mi) east of Quito, and because of its location it is also colloquially known as Tababela Airport. The airport currently serves as the main hub for Avianca Ecuador and the largest hub for LATAM Ecuador. It also served as the main hub for TAME, Ecuador's flag-carrier, before the airline was liquidated by the Ecuadorian government in 2020. The airport opened in February 2013 and replaced the 53-year old airport of the same name. The airport is named after independence leader Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre. It was the first 5-star airport in the Western Hemisphere as rated by Skytrax.",
