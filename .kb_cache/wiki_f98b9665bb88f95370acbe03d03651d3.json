A ship departing from Puerto Rico attempted to ship aid into the Venezuelan port city of Puerto Cabello. Six vessels of the Venezuelan Navy, including the Mariscal Sucre-class frigate Almirante Brion and patrol boats, were deployed to prevent the entry of the aid shipment. The ship, carrying civilians, returned to Puerto Rico after the Venezuelan Navy threatened to \"open fire\" on the humanitarian ship. Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello, who ordered the return of the ship, stated that the act by the Venezuelan Navy was \"unacceptable and shameful\" and that Puerto Rico \"notified our partners in the U.S. government about this serious incident\".",

Naiguat\u00e1 sank following the collision, with RCGS Resolute informing the international Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) of the incident and offering assistance. After staying in the area for an hour, RCGS Resolute was informed through MRCC that assistance was not required as Naiguat\u00e1's crew had been rescued by the Venezuelan Navy.",

She was contacted by Venezuelan patrol boat Naiguat\u00e1 on the night of 30 March. Two hours later, an unexpected change in Naiguat\u00e1's heading just before the collision may have been caused by a suction effect between the vessels as the faster patrol boat passed the bow of the cruise ship. Although the collision may have not been intentional ramming, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of Naiguat\u00e1 was a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.",
