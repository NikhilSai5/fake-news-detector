In the 1970s, the Maharishi introduced advanced meditative techniques and his movement grew to encompass TM programs for schools, universities and prisons. In the 1980s additional programs aimed at improved health and well-being were developed based on the Maharishi's interpretation of the Vedic traditions. By the late 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of individuals, and the Maharishi oversaw a large multinational movement which has continued since his death in 2008.

The district court dismissed Kropinski's claims concerning intentional tort and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and referred the claims of fraud and negligent infliction of physical and psychological injuries to a jury trial. The jury awarded Kropinski $137,890 in the fraud and negligence claims. The appellate court overturned the award and dismissed Kropinski's claim alleging psychological damage. The claim of fraud and the claim of a physical injury related to his practice of the TM-Sidhi program were remanded to the lower court for retrial. Kropinski, Green, Ryan and the defendants settled the remaining claims out of court on undisclosed terms. The remaining suit by Hendel, not included in the settlement, was later dismissed because the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. In affirming the dismissal, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit held that Hendel's claims were time-barred under the discovery rule because \"...the defendants made representations which any reasonable person would recognize as being contrary to common human experience and, indeed, to the laws of physics. If, as Ms. Hendel alleges, she was told that meditators would slowly rise in the air, and that some of them were 'flying over Lake Lucern' or 'walking through walls, hovering, and becoming invisible,' and that her failure to go to bed on time could bring about World War III, then a reasonable person would surely have noticed, at some time prior to September 1, 1986, that some of these representations might not be true.\"",

According to the 1980 book, TM and Cult Mania, scientists associated with TM have attempted to prove the Maharishi's concepts by uniting scientific data and mystical philosophy. The 2010 book, Teaching Mindfulness, says that TM's eventual success as a new social movement was based on the \"translation in Western language and settings, popular recognition, adoption within scientific research in powerful institutions.\" The book goes on to say that TM's \"use of sophisticated marketing and public relations techniques, represents a model for success in the building of new social movements\". Sociologist Hank Johnston, who analyzed TM as a \"marketed social movement\" in a 1980 paper, says that TM has used sophisticated techniques, such as tailored promotional messages for different audiences, and pragmatically adapted them to different cultures and changing times. Johnston says that TM's \"calculated strategies\" have led to its \"rapid growth\". In particular, it has objectified the rank-and-file membership, marketed the movement as a product, and created a perception of grievances for which it offers a panacea. In her book, The Field, author Lynne McTaggart notes that the \"organization has been ridiculed, largely because of the promotion of the Maharishi's own personal interests\", but suggests that \"the sheer weight of data...[on the Maharishi Effect]...is compelling\". According to an article in The Independent, despite early criticism, the TM technique has moved from margin to mainstream, due mostly to its \"burgeoning body of scientific research\". Its recent appeal seems due to the possibility of relaxation with no chemical assistance.  Jerrold Greenberg in his book Comprehensive Stress Management writes that the Maharishi was a \"major exporter of meditation to the Western world\" who \"developed a large, worldwide, and highly effective organization to teach Transcendental Meditation\". Greenberg goes on to say that \"the simplicity of this technique, coupled with the effectiveness of its marketing by TM organizations quickly led to its popularity.\" According to Goldberg, research and meditation in general are likely to be the Maharishi's \"lasting legacy\".",

    "text": "The Maharishi believed that in order to maintain the continuity of Transcendental Meditation it had to be taught by trained teachers in dedicated centers. Maharishi recorded his lectures; systematized the teaching of the technique, insisted the technique not be mixed with other techniques and separated the technique from other points of view and practices that might confuse its understanding. He said that the \"purity of the system of meditation\" must be  maintained \"at any cost because the effect lies in the purity of the teaching\". TM practitioners that are suspected of interacting with other gurus can be banned from meditations and lose other privileges. In the 1990s, Maharishi prohibited his students from interacting with Deepak Chopra. As a result, Lowe writes, the number of sufficiently orthodox practitioners was significantly reduced by 2007.  In 1983, Robin Wadsworth Carlson began teaching his meditation program via a \"World Teacher Seminar.\" Many students at Maharishi International University (MIU) were suspended after describing the literature promoting the seminar. In response Carlson filed a lawsuit against MIU alleging interference in conducting his seminars.",

He also describes the TM movement in terms of Roy Wallis's typological terms as a world affirming rather than world renouncing or world accommodating new religious movement. According to religious studies scholar, Tamar Gablinger, the \"complex structure\" of the TM organization falls somewhere  between being a commercial entity and a religious and social movement. Gablinger says this allows sociologists to categorize it in a variety of ways. Both Gablinger and sociologist Hank Johnston describe the TM organization as a \"marketed social movement.\"",

He cites research by Barmark and Gautnitz which showed the similarities between the states obtained by Transcendental Meditation and ASCs. In this way, not only does the subject become more reliant on the ASC, but it allows for a weakening of criticism of the cult and increase in faith therein. Abgrall goes on to note that the use of mantras is one of the most widespread techniques in cults, noting in TM this mantra is produced mentally. He says that a guru is usually central to a cult and that its success will rely on how effective that guru is. Among the common characteristics of a guru he notes paraphrenia, a mental illness that completely cuts the individual from reality. In regard to this he notes for example, that the Maharishi recommended the TM-Sidhi program including 'yogic flying' as a way to reduce crime.",

Wallis goes on to say that \"no rigorous discipline is normally involved\" and \"no extensive doctrinal commitment is entailed, at least not at the outset\". Likewise, he writes, \"No one is required to declare a belief in TM, in the Maharishi or even in the possible effects of the technique\". In a later chapter called \"The Precariousness of the Market\", he writes that TM meditators are \"expected to employ the movement's rhetoric and conceptual vocabulary\" and shift from an empirical product [the Transcendental Meditation technique] to a \"system of belief and practice\" [such as the TM Sidhi program] and in this way \"the movement shifts from cult towards sect\". Sociologist Alan E. Aldridge writes that Transcendental Meditation fits Roy Wallis' definition of a \"world-affirming religion\". According to Aldridge, TM has an ethos of \"individual self-realization\" and \"an inner core of committed members\" who practice more advanced techniques (the TM-Sidhi program) that may not even be known to the \"ordinary consumer of TM\".",

For the first time in his travels he found people he believed to be truly deluded, and a physics department teaching theories that were dead wrong.
