Cuban hurdler Dayron Robles set his 2008 world record of 12.87 using a 7-step start. Chinese star Liu Xiang won the 2004 Olympics and broke the world record in 2006 utilizing an 8-step approach, but he switched to 7-steps by the 2011 outdoor season. After the 2010 outdoor season, American Jason Richardson trained to switch to a 7-step start and went on to win the 2011 World Championship. American Aries Merritt trained in Fall 2011 to switch from 8 to 7, and then had his greatest outdoor season in 2012 \u2013 running 8 races in under 13 seconds \u2013 capped by winning the London 2012 Olympics and then setting a world record of 12.80.",

    "text": "In American high school track and field and at many international Under-20 athletics competitions, the 110 metres hurdles are mostly the same as their professional counterparts. The main difference between the junior-level hurdles and professional hurdles is the height. Junior-level hurdles are 99.1 centimetres (39 in) tall while professional-level hurdles are 106.7 centimetres (42 in) tall. This change in height drastically changes the requirements placed on the hurdler to clear the barrier with the same amount of speed. Junior-level hurdling technique is the same as professional except on the higher hurdles everything is exaggerated. As a junior makes the transition to professional level there are many things they must adjust to, the most prevailing issue is getting down after clearing the hurdle. junior-level hurdlers are used to the normal sprinting motion right after they get off the hurdle but for a newly transitioned professional-level hurdler that extra half a second can feel very foreign. The second major difference in technique is the take-off distance. When a junior-level hurdler approaches his first hurdle they are putting as much power into each step as possible and attempting to gain all the speed they can so by their eighth step they'll be about 2 m away from the hurdle. When attempting to clear a 106 cm hurdle the athlete can no longer run headfirst into the hurdle with disregard for the height of the hurdle. Professional hurdler need to learn how to shorten their strides so they can take off the ground from farther away to clear a higher barrier.",
