It starts when the sun is close to the horizon and overlaps both twilight and night. The exact times when evening begins and ends are subjective and depend on location and time of year. In some cases, evening is considered to begin during daylight; before sunset.",

Evening (and morning) serves as the optimum time for viewing the inferior planets Venus and Mercury. It is a popular time to hunt for comets, as their tails grow more prominent as these objects draw closer to the Sun. The evening (and morning) twilight is used to search for near-Earth asteroids that orbit inside the orbit of the Earth. In mid-latitudes, spring evenings around the time of the equinox\u2015that is, the March one in the Northern Hemisphere and the September equinox to the south of the equator\u2015are favorable for viewing the zodiacal light.",
