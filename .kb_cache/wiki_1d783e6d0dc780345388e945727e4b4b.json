Other agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Education (ED), would be dismantled. It calls for reducing environmental regulations to favor fossil fuels and proposes making the National Institutes of Health (NIH) less independent while defunding its stem cell research. The blueprint seeks to reduce taxes on corporations, institute a flat income tax on individuals, cut Medicare and Medicaid, and reverse as many of President Joe Biden's policies as possible. It proposes banning pornography, removing legal protections against anti-LGBT discrimination, and ending diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs while having the DOJ prosecute anti-white racism. The project recommends the arrest, detention, and mass deportation of illegal immigrants, and deploying the U.S. Armed Forces for domestic law enforcement. The plan also proposes enacting laws supported by the Christian right, such as criminalizing the sending and receiving of abortion and birth control medications and eliminating coverage of emergency contraception.",

The document described operational plans and targets, including the size and location of Israeli forces, and raised questions in Israel about how Hamas learned these details. The document provided a plan that included a large-scale rocket assault before an invasion, drones to knock out the surveillance cameras and automated guns that Israel has stationed along the border, and gunmen invading Israel, including with paragliders. The Times reported, \"Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision.\" According to The Times, the document was widely circulated among Israeli military and intelligence leadership, who largely dismissed the plan as beyond Hamas's capabilities, though it was unclear whether the political leadership was informed. In July 2023, a member of the Israeli signals intelligence unit alerted her superiors that Hamas was conducting preparations for the assault, saying, \"I utterly refute that the scenario is imaginary\". An Israeli colonel ignored her concerns.",

It concluded that these were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence during the October 7 massacres. The probe was said to have been based on video footage, photographs, GPS data from mobile phones, and interviews with more than 150 people. According to reporting by The Intercept, the New York Times investigation has been criticized, both externally and internally by other employees, for apparent discrepancies in witness accounts and lax evidentiary standards. On December 30, The Daily Telegraph wrote: \"First responders to massacre saw raped and abused bodies, but the rapidity of events\u2014and cultural taboos\u2014may leave the truth uncovered\". Al-Jazeera concluded that the \"allegations of widespread and systematic rape\", allegations it said \"were used repeatedly by politicians in Israel and the West to justify the ferocity of the subsequent bombardment of the Gaza Strip\", were false. On March 25, 2024, The New York Times reported that new video had surfaced, contradicting the account of an Israeli military paramedic previously interviewed by the Times that two teenagers murdered in Be'eri had also been sexually assaulted.",

Patten also reported receiving \"clear and convincing information\" that some of the hostages held by Hamas had suffered rape and sexualized torture and that there were \"reasonable grounds\" to believe such abuses were \"ongoing\". The report stemmed from an unprecedented fact-finding mission to \"verify information\" and was not a full and legal investigation as Patten's office lacks such a mandate. It was thus unable to establish anything beyond a reasonable doubt. As American journalist Azadeh Moaveni reported: \"Her office didn't have a mandate to investigate sexual crimes on the ground and had never undertaken such a mission before. I was told by multiple sources at the UN that her trip was a matter of fierce controversy within the organisation.\" Patten's report also did not determine that the sexual violence was systematic in nature, did not attribute it to Hamas or other factions, did not find evidence of it being planned, and remained agnostic on its scope. Patten was also unable to find some evidence that Israeli politicians insisted existed, including video and photographic evidence of rape. The report concludes that \"specific attribution of the violations would require a fully-fledged investigation\". Later, Patten, the UN's special representative, requested permission to investigate Hamas's alleged crimes, on condition that her team should also be allowed to access Israeli detention facilities to examine claims of sexual violence by Israeli soldiers, but the request was denied.",

At 10:32 AM, an order was issued to all battalions in the area to fire mortars towards Gaza.

At 6:40 p.m., the army launched artillery raids at the border area \"very close\" to Kibbutz Be'eri and Kfar Azza. It is unclear how many hostages were killed by friendly fire.

Palestinians detainees released after October 7 have reported that Israeli authorities ordered them to make statements, beat them severely, and sometimes demanded that they make statements with a gun pointed to their face. The UN and reports by human rights organizations such as B'Tselem and media outlets have confirmed Israeli systematic use of torture during the Gaza War, including rape, gang-rape, sexualized torture and mutilation of detained Palestinian men, women and children by Israeli guards, including during interrogations.",

Azadeh Moaveni reported that claims of double standards or lack of condemnation by UN Women were incorrect, as: UN Women has not inveighed against conflict-related sexual violence in Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Colombia or Mali, and its condemnations of rape in the DRC, Central African Republic, Syria and Iraq came years after the events themselves. Where it has responded more swiftly (and then only within months), it has done so in places where the UN had teams on the ground investigating and documenting abuses, or as a result of UN-wide appeals. UN Women has never named a specific group or perpetrator. According to its own protocols, it has been vociferous in responding to October 7 \u2013 as many as eight times in the first two months \u2013 through statements, social media posts and session remarks. Moaveni also notes that what was demanded of UN Women was to go beyond its mandate and name in an unprecedented way before a proper investigation by the mandated UN bodies had been carried out, and that if it had done so it would have significantly damaged its relationships with grassroots women's groups.",
