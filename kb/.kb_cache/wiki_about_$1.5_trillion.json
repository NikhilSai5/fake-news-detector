I'm allowed to do that. I'm a human being\". Malone began exploring country music for the first time in 2023, when he appeared on a re-recording of \"Pickup Man\" by Joe Diffie, reaching the Hot Country Songs chart for the first time at number 34. In March 2024, he appeared on Beyonc\u00e9's country album Cowboy Carter as a featured artist on the track \"Levii's Jeans\", later peaking at number 5 on the Hot Country Songs chart.",

It is a country album with country pop elements. In an interview with Apple Music, Malone explained the recording and writing process of the album:\"I've always wanted to make a record like this, but for the longest time, it seems so inaccessible because I don't know how the hell it works. But going in there and meeting Derek and Larry Franklin and Paul Franklin and Craig and Dave Cohen and Aaron, and it was just, like, so cool. And then it's crazy to watch Derek Charta a playthrough of a voice memo and chart it and then go in there and they know it immediately. But we would go for like a week at a time or like a week and a half and around work and everything, and we would go and just write. And there's a lot of writers on these songs because we just sat and we stayed up till, like, six in the morning. All the buddies came in. We all just drank and fucking tossed shit around.  And I learned that that's nothing usually, how it goes. Instead, we have, like, Luke and Mo and Hardy, and we're just sitting. And we got so many writers and not even necessarily there to write, just to, like, jam and then hang out.\"",

Murray states that even though F-1 Trillion at times is \"struggling beneath its own weight\", the album \"is a love letter to the genre\". Neil Z. Yeung from AllMusic reviewed F-1 Trillion positively, describing the album as \"full-on country foray\" and opining that the album will please fans of the country music genre. In a positive review, Joseph Hudak of Rolling Stone wrote that the album would have benefited from containing fewer features and more solo songs from Malone. Hudak praised \"the most stripped-down\" tracks, highlighting \"Never Love You Again\", \"Missin' You Like This\", and \"M-E-X-I-C-O\". Writing for The Independent, Helen Brown praised Malone's songwriting skills and states that the album showcases his skills in songcraft. She wrote that although F-1 Trillion \"loses some of his distinctive sound \u2013 and has none of the cool experiments of Beyonc\u00e9's record \u2013 it also showcases his undeniable songcrafting [sic] chops. Drivetime DJs are going to love it, and their listeners are all going to feel they're at the wheels of beaten-up American trucks\".",

Garvey comments further on Malone's entry into the country music scene, writing that \"there's enough proof here that Post has the voice, demeanor, and goodwill to easily ingratiate himself into the Nashville scene\". Neil McCormick of The Telegraph commended the album, writing that it represents \"pure good ol' boy country\" and that \"Malone proves genuinely good at this stuff, with a sharp lyrical wit and sweet singing voice that rises to heights of soulful passion when needs be, notably on the disco flecked 'What Don't Belong to Me' and twisty alt-folk of 'Nosedive'\".",

    "text": "In a mixed review, Michael Cragg of The Guardian believed the album to be \"a little formulaic\" and in need of more risk-taking by Malone. Cragg wrote that \"there's a lot to enjoy about F-1 Trillion, and it feels tailor-made for chart domination, but as much as Malone felt hip hop was limiting his oeuvre, it at least gifted him moments to really let loose, as on the ludicrous epic 'Take What You Want' featuring Ozzy Osbourne and Travis Scott. On F-1 Trillion, trussed up in full country cosplay, he's shooting a little too straight\". In a review for Consequence, Mary Siroky wrote that \"F-1 Trillion is enjoyable because Post Malone came to have fun \u2014 and, more importantly, to commit fully to a genre he has clearly long enjoyed and admired. He did the work, and it paid off. The tunes are accessible and perfectly aligned with what so many people love about the genre, but if Malone continues in this vein, the things he should chase are those moments where his heart is totally on the line\". Garvey opined that \"most of the collaborations are solid\" on the record, praising Dolly Parton's performance on \"Have The Heart\", while criticizing the song \"Hide My Gun\" and the opening track \"Wrong Ones\" for their lack of energy. Ammar Kalia of The Observer described F-1 Trillion as \"surprisingly enjoyable\", while deeming it too long, \"overly polished and missing the instrumental virtuosity central to the genre\".",
