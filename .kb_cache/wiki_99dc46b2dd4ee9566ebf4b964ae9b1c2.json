Among them were Mexican sides Pachuca and Le\u00f3n, both owned by Grupo Pachuca. FIFA regulations prohibit any club from owning shares in, being a member of, or exerting influence over another participating club, with \"influence\" defined through control of voting rights or decision-making authority. In November 2024, Costa Rican club Alajuelense requested FIFA to apply this rule and disqualify one of the two Grupo Pachuca clubs, threatening legal action if no action was taken. Alajuelense argued that it was next in line to qualify under CONCACAF's rankings, but FIFA determined the club could not be party to proceedings. On February 4, 2025, Alajuelense appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against FIFA, Pachuca, and Le\u00f3n. On March 21, FIFA announced that Le\u00f3n had been removed from the tournament. According to The Guardian, a play-off would determine the replacement between Los Angeles FC, runner-up of the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, and Am\u00e9rica, the highest-ranked Mexican club not already qualified. Alajuelense and Philadelphia Union were not considered. Le\u00f3n appealed, and hearings for both its case and Alajuelense's took place in April and May 2025 respectively, but on May 6 FIFA confirmed that Le\u00f3n's expulsion would stand and that the play-off would proceed. LAFC secured the final spot with a 2\u20131 extra time win over Am\u00e9rica on May 31 at BMO Stadium.",

    "text": "Ticket prices for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup attracted early scrutiny from some fans, who noted that certain final seats were listed at over US$2,200 due to dynamic pricing models, although FIFA later adjusted prices in February 2025, lowering them to around US$140 for the semifinals and US$300 for the final to make the tournament more accessible. A 10 percent cancellation fee applied to exchanges also drew attention, but the overall response to the tournament was positive. The opening fixture between Al Ahly and Inter Miami saw strong turnout following final-week promotional campaigns, and FIFA reported over 60,000 spectators in attendance, with strong international broadcast figures. By early July, FIFA had recorded over 2 million tickets sold and average attendance of approximately 36,000 per match, a figure comparable to several leading European domestic leagues. While 14 matches attracted smaller crowds of under 20,000, mostly at MLS venues, 11 fixtures surpassed 90 percent capacity, including six at Hard Rock Stadium. Supporters from South America, Africa and Asia were especially prominent throughout the tournament, although a match involving Wydad AC and Juventus saw minor incidents involving smoke bombs and one arrest.",

    "text": "As with previous editions of the FIFA Club World Cup, the expanded 2025 format allocated a slot for the host nation. This slot had traditionally been filled by the domestic league champion of the host country. In the United States, the champion of Major League Soccer is determined through the MLS Cup playoffs, rather than regular season performance, and for the 2024 season, that playoff had not yet concluded at the time FIFA needed to confirm its selection. During the mid-season 2024 MLS All-Star Game, MLS Commissioner Don Garber stated that the slot could be awarded to the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield winner, the MLS Cup 2024 winner, or via a playoff between the two. On October 19, 2024, FIFA announced that Inter Miami CF would represent the host nation as winners of the Supporters' Shield, awarding the slot before the start of the 2024 MLS Cup playoffs and after Inter Miami had already secured the Shield. FIFA stated that this decision aligned with past precedent, where clubs that won silverware in a league-style format were prioritised for the host slot, and that the announcement had been delayed due to procedural timelines for confirming regulations. Although the decision drew scrutiny from some sections of the media and fanbase, particularly regarding its timing and the involvement of Lionel Messi, others viewed it as a practical resolution in keeping with the tournament's structure and historical practice. Inter Miami were later eliminated from the playoffs by Atlanta United FC in the first round on November 10, but head coach Gerardo Martino defended the club's inclusion on the grounds that the Supporters' Shield constituted a valid and recognised form of domestic achievement.",

    "text": "On June 10, 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced their involvement in providing security during the first round of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and reminded non-American citizens to carry valid proof of legal stay. The announcement raised concerns among some fans regarding the Trump administration's deportation policy, especially as those detained could potentially face indefinite detention or be transferred to other countries such as El Salvador. FIFA President Gianni Infantino defended the increased security presence, stating that the safety of fans was a top priority, particularly in light of the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica final, which was held in the same stadium and saw large numbers of supporters storm the gates to gain entry. Just days later, on June 15, reports surfaced that Boca Juniors defender Ayrton Costa had initially been denied a US visa due to a 2018 robbery case, although the decision was subsequently reversed and he was issued a special 26-day visa to participate in the tournament.",

    "text": "The tournament intensified the rivalry between European teams and the rest of the world, in particular the South Americans. Initially the debate involved how well the non-European teams would fare against the European teams; it then intensified when South American teams began to record victories against their European counterparts. Some South American managers, fans, and journalists also tried to dismiss European criticism of the tournament as \"loser excuses\" and a \"symbol of European arrogance and elitism\". Commentators questioned whether European dominance had been overstated, with analysis suggesting that the myth of superiority was being tested by results on the pitch. In response, Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique remarked that South Americans had no need to compare themselves with Europeans, emphasising the shared global stature of both footballing regions and pointing to the widespread recruitment of South American players by European clubs. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola offered a more supportive view of South American competitiveness, arguing that European fans should not be surprised when clubs from the region secure wins and that such outcomes reflect the real global balance of quality in football. The increased attention to Brazilian clubs also led to a sharp spike in global interest in the Brazilian League, with Google Trends reporting the highest search volume for the term since 2020. While the performances reignited continental pride, the on-field results remained competitive; in twelve direct UEFA\u2013CONMEBOL encounters, European clubs registered six wins, South American clubs won three times, and three matches ended in draws.",
