In the year 2021, direct-to-consumer e-commerce sales in the United States were over $128 billion. Examples of DTC brands currently in business include: Allbirds, Away, Dollar Shave Club, Everlane, Glossier, and Warby Parker.",

Data privacy and cybersecurity are especially important in online businesses. Accepting online payments can make DTC businesses a target for hackers and cybercriminals, exposing them to the risks of fraudulent payments and false chargebacks. The direct-to-consumer business model puts the entire burden of the supply chain onto the firm itself; rather than selling to only a few distributors, the products must be delivered to many individual customers.",
