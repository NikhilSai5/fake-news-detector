According to investigative reports, JeM utilizes Pakistani fintech platforms such as EasyPaisa and SadaPay to collect and move funds domestically and internationally. These digital wallets enable the group to bypass traditional banking scrutiny, especially following the increased financial monitoring imposed during Pakistan\u2019s engagement with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). JeM is believed to operate over 2,000 active digital wallet accounts, collectively moving an estimated PKR 800\u2013900 million (approximately USD 2.8\u20133.2 million) annually. The group employs a rotation model whereby funds are cycled through multiple wallets and dispersed into smaller transactions, making tracing and enforcement challenging. These wallets are reportedly linked to senior JeM figures and are used to solicit donations for purported reconstruction efforts, while a substantial portion of the funds is allegedly diverted to procure arms and support operational infrastructure. Indian Intelligence report reportedly linked the fundraising activities of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) to several digital wallet accounts. These included a SadaPay account registered under the name Talha Al Saif (also known as Talha Gulzar), associated with a phone number reportedly used by Haripur district commander Aftab Ahmed. Additional accounts included an EasyPaisa wallet operated by Abdullah Azhar, son of JeM founder Masood Azhar, and another belonging to Syed Safdar Shah, a JeM commander in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Reports suggested the group maintains over 250 active EasyPaisa wallets and creates approximately 30 new accounts monthly, potentially to obscure the origins of its funding.",
