Montoya got funding working as a delivery boy for his father, learnt racecraft and mechanical engineering from him, and was inspired by drivers Roberto Guerrero and Ayrton Senna. He raced in a self-organised karting championship due to the Colombian Karting Federation's financial problems. Montoya won the 1984 Colombian Children's National Karting Championship, was second in the 1985 Colombian National Karting Championship and won the following year's local and national titles.

During the season, Montoya won no races but was more competitive and consistent with ten top-ten finishes and improved his qualifying performances in the first 26 races, and drove better on most types of tracks (including oval tracks) by racing conservatively and Pattie convincing him to replace aggressive race setups and on-track risks with long-term thinking and intelligent driving. This was due to his car's increased power, his developing experience and patience, and Pattie's calm demeanour. Montoya had been enough acquainted with the Car of Tomorrow by mid-2009, when he adjusted his driving style to slow down in order to be faster. In the Aaron's 499 at Talladega, he qualified on pole for the first time in his Cup Series career before finishing second in the Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. He was tenth in points after the second race at Richmond Raceway and qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup. A pole position in the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway along with six top-ten finishes put him as high as third place in the standings but was eliminated from title contention after a series of accidents. He was eighth overall with 6,252 points.",
