It serves as a prequel and a stealth sequel to the television series Twin Peaks (1990\u20131991), created and produced by Mark Frost and Lynch. It begins with the FBI's investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks (Pamela Gidley) before shifting to the last seven days of the life of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a popular-but-troubled high school student in the fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington. Palmer's murder was the primary plot thread of the TV series.",

Although most of the television cast reprised their roles for the film, many comparatively lighthearted scenes featuring town residents were cut. In addition, the series' main star, Kyle MacLachlan (Dale Cooper), asked for his role to be downsized, and Lara Flynn Boyle's character Donna Hayward was recast with Moira Kelly. In 2014, several deleted scenes were recut and released as Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces.",

    "text": "Fire Walk with Me premiered at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival in competition for the Palme d'Or. The film was notoriously polarizing: Lynch said that the film was booed at Cannes, and the American press generally panned the film. The film was controversial for its frank and vivid depiction of child sexual abuse, its relative absence of fan-favorite characters, and its surrealistic style. The film was a box-office bomb in North America, but fared better in Japan and France. Due to the poor reception, plans for a sequel were abandoned. However, the film has been positively re-evaluated in the 21st century, and is now widely regarded as one of Lynch's major works. Lynch and Frost eventually received funding to produce a third season of the TV series in 2017, which revisited several plot threads from the film. In 2019, the British Film Institute ranked Fire Walk with Me the fourth-best film of the 1990s.",

Michael Wilmington (Los Angeles Times) asserted that the film \"isn't a superior movie\" on its own, but argued that the combination of the film and series was \"a pop-cultural landmark, with all the bad taste and high style required.\"",

One of the few American critics who publicly defended the film was Steve Erickson (LA Weekly), who wrote that while the film's first act was marred by \"extraneous weirdness and sophomoric symbolism\", Laura Palmer's story was \"remarkable and disturbingly authentic.\" He questioned why the film community was so quick to attack the film, explaining that \"we're happy to ... celebrate genius when all it means is some kind of kooky eccentricity\", but \"when that genius insists on its own dark audacity\", the community treats it like \"radioactive waste\". He concluded that \"people are ultimately appalled not by [the film's] badness but its integrity.\" In 1998, critic Manohla Dargis (also LA Weekly) called Erickson's review \"one of the bravest pieces of film criticism I've read\". Jay Boyar (Orlando Sentinel) also praised the film, calling its unvarnished portrayal of Laura Palmer's suffering \"sensationally strong\". He acknowledged that the film would have trouble finding its audience, as it alienated both fans of the series and non-fans of the series, but concluded that someone who both had \"seen most of the series\" and \"was willing to let go of the series\" could fully appreciate \"the movie's dramatically different perspective\".",

Jeff Dawson (Empire) added that while the film was \"quite probably\" on some level \"pretentious codswallop\", the film was a \"triumph\" and Lynch's \"darkest, most disturbing film to date\". However, not all British critics praised the film. Alexander Walker (Evening Standard) wrote that \"the whole production exudes a contempt for viewers\". Barry Norman (BBC) said that while he felt \"seething irritation\" while watching the film, it began to \"ma[k]e a kind of sense\" to him over time, and his opinion was improving. He cautioned that Lynch was \"a very original filmmaker, and since there are so few of those about, we ought perhaps to give him the benefit of the doubt, and indulge him a little.\"",
