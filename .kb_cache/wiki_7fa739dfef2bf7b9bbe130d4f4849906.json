Originally consisting of 1,560 shops, the bazaar was 40 yards wide and 1,520 yards long. The bazaar, fashion to resemble a square, was accorded ample elegance by the presence of a pool at the complex's center.

Claudia Puig of USA Today said, \"This Indian/Chinese cinematic hybrid is likable and entertaining but overlong and occasionally hokey\", and that Kumar's \"physical humor brings to mind Jim Carrey\". John Anderson of Variety wrote, \"If Chandni Chowk to China were a person, it would need Valium\", and found that \"everything is fast and furious, hilarious, hysterical and frantic. Some of the sequences as are quite beautiful and, in the case of the dance numbers featuring Padukone, stunning. But it's the fight scenes as that truly take off\". Frank Lovece of Newsday wrote, \"Less a Bollywood bonbon than a pan-Asian fusion dish, this combination of Indian musical and Chinese chopsocky is, nonetheless, delicious fun\".",

And then, for the next two hours-plus, it's agony.\" Scott Tobias of The Onion described the film as \"crass, schizophrenic, culturally insensitive, horribly paced, and shameless in its pandering to the lowest common denominator\", while Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said, \"This galumphing elephant of a chopsocky revenge-of-the-nerd quasi-musical lacks the lyrical choreographic beauty that has marked such Stateside Bollywood releases as the gorgeous Lagaan\". Michael Philips of the Chicago Tribune called the film \"a massive and rather tiring showcase for Bollywood action hero Akshay Kumar\". Indian critic Taran Adarsh gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, calling it \"a big, big, big letdown\". Rajeev Masand of IBN termed it a tiring watch, while praising Kumar's performance.",
