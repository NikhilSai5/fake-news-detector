Semanthe was later used by other English or Irish writers for characters in works of fiction published in the 17th and 18th centuries, including for a character in the 1682 tragic play The Loyal Brother by Irish dramatist Thomas Southerne, a character in the 1690 tragic play The Treacherous Brothers by English playwright George Powell, a character in the 1699 tragic play Friendship Improved by Anglo-Irish dramatist Charles Hopkins, a character in the 1705 tragic play Ulysses by English dramatist Nicholas Rowe, a character in the 1718 historical tragic play Scipo Africanus by English dramatist Charles Beckingham, and in 1758 for an English translation of the works of Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, Marquise de Maintenon. In 1712, the name Semanthe was used in an article in the English periodical The Spectator. Irish poet Mary Barber used the name Samantha in a poem published in her 1734 Poems on Several Occasions.",

    "text": "The etymology of the name Samantha is uncertain. Speculation has suggested an origin from the masculine given name Samuel and anthos, the Greek word for \"flower\". One theory is that it was a feminine form of Samuel, to which the already existing feminine name Anthea was added. Another theory is that it is an American English version of the Dutch name Sijmentje, a feminine form of Sjimen, the Dutch form of Sigmund. It also might have developed from Semanthe, with influences from other existing names. The name Semanthe was used by 17th and 18th century writers along with other character names that sounded Greek but did not have a history of use in Greece, or that sounded exotic to an English audience. It might also have been inspired by existing names from classical mythology such as Semele and Semiramis in combination with the Greek anthos. The dominant pronunciation of the name might have shifted from Semanthe to Samantha and English speakers might later have associated the name with Samuel. Sementhe might also have been influenced by the Greek mythological Nereid Psamathe, whose name appeared in another 18th century source as Psamanthe.",

Portraying Anasuya Ramalingam, a naive girl trying to escape from her mother's controlling behavior, Samantha received highly positive reviews for her character portrayal. A critic from The New Indian Express noted \"A Aa undoubtedly is Samantha's film\" and that \"right from her first frame till the last, she delivers a stellar performance and shows what she can do if given ample screen time\", adding that she was \"a joy to watch\". Likewise, a reviewer from The Hindu noted \"Samantha, after a long time, gets enough screen time and scope to shine\", stating \"she's vulnerable as a 23-year-old reeling in her mother's shadow and can also play the high maintenance, stubborn girl with ease\", while concluding \"this is a role she can be proud of\". Similarly Bollywoodlife.com noted her \"earnest performance was the life and soul of the romantic comedy\", while DNA India's critic cited that \"Samantha and Nithiin's performances in this movie will be what people would rave about for days to come\". The film also performed well at the box office, doing excellent business for a Telugu film released in the United States. Her performance fetched her several awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actress \u2013 Telugu, her second win in the category. She then featured in the commercially successful action film Janatha Garage directed by Koratala Siva, with a critic noting despite \"a limited role, she gives a nice performance\". She then portrayed the lead female role in Atlee's Mersal, and featured alongside Vijay for the third time and her performance received positive reviews and the film became one of the highest grossing Tamil films of 2017 and was a blockbuster at the box office. Mersal went on to join the coveted \u20b9200 crore club.",
