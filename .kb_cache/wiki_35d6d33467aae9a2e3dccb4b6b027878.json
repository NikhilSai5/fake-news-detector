That was also the original representation of 3 in the Brahmic (Indian) numerical notation, its earliest forms aligned vertically.  However, during the Gupta Empire the sign was modified by the addition of a curve on each line. The N\u0101gar\u012b script rotated the lines clockwise, so they appeared horizontally, and ended each line with a short downward stroke on the right. In cursive script, the three strokes were eventually connected to form a glyph resembling a \u27e83\u27e9 with an additional stroke at the bottom: \u0969.",
