Such content can contain snippets of videos taken out of context and made as memes, and can also be used to attract the public to the user's other accounts or their other long-form contents.",

It combines the entertainment of short videos with the convenience of e-commerce, forming a business logic of \"content is marketing, interaction is transaction\". The process is first content creation and product display. The anchor or brand will introduce the product through live streaming, including trial, evaluation and promotion information. The second is real-time interaction. Users can interact with the anchor through comments, likes and questions to enhance the sense of trust in purchase and allow consumers to gain an immersive purchasing experience and emotional value in interpersonal relationships. The anchor can display the product in a variety of ways, such as product close-ups, trials, promotions, etc., and eliminate consumers' concerns and reservations through words, enhance their social presence and provide a positive emotional experience. Finally, one-click purchase and instant transaction. Users can directly click on the product link in the live broadcast to jump to the purchase page, shorten the decision path and improve the conversion rate.",

Although e-commerce live streaming has achieved great success in China, it still faces challenges in promoting it in the international market. However, some platforms are actively trying, such as TikTok Shop: TikTok took the lead in promoting the live streaming sales model in the Southeast Asian market, and piloted \"TikTok Shop\" in the UK market, allowing brands and influencers to sell goods through live streaming.

And payment methods, logistics services and after-sales systems need to be improved to match the instant transaction needs of e-commerce live streaming.
