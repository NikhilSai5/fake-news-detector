It consists of five equal horizontal stripes, alternating from red to white, with a blue equilateral triangle based on the hoist side bearing a large, sharp, upright, five-pointed white star in the center. The white star stands for the archipelago and island, the three sides of the triangle for the three branches of the government, the blue for the sky and coastal waters, the red for the blood shed by warriors, and the white for liberty, victory, and peace. The flag is popularly known as the Monoestrellada (Monostarred), meaning having one star, a single star, or a lone star. It is in the Stars and Stripes flag family.",

The flags contain coat of arms or images associated with the region, including birds, animals, or crops. Many pay tribute to the indigenous Ta\u00edno people of Puerto Rico, who ruled the island before the European colonization. For example the flag of Utuado, features a Taino sun in honor of Cacique Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 or The Great Sun. Others honor the Spanish political, ancestral, and cultural roots of the island. For example, the flag of San Germ\u00e1n, honors Spain with a Spanish coat of arms.",

The origin of the flag traces back to the early morning of July 4, 2016, when a group of female members of Artistas Solidarixs y en Resistencia (Artists in Solidarity and Resistance) repainted a popular and well-known mural of the original red, white, and light blue (presumed by historians) flag, on the door of 55 Calle San Jos\u00e9 in Old San Juan, with stark black and white to symbolize that the flag is in mourning over the passing of the law Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which had just been signed into law by President Barack Obama.",

The Board, infamously known by protesting Puerto Ricans as \u201cLa Junta\u201d (\"The Board\"), has been heavily criticized by many as an act of blatant colonialism, as it claims to be at the service of the Puerto Rican people, but it is not based in Puerto Rico, and it is not electorally accountable to the voters of Puerto Rico. The black flag has become a common symbol of protest and defiance in Puerto Rico.",

The current flag of Puerto Rico was legalized during the 1952 Summer Olympics, and the Puerto Rican team began to use it immediately. However, as a result of the Gag Law of 1948, which outlawed the display of the current flag of Puerto Rico in the archipelago and island, the Olympics flag continued to be use by the government in Puerto Rico until the law was repealed in 1957.",

The company has claimed that their flag has been in use since at least 1903, and that although the design of the Puerto Rican flag is eight years older than their flag, it was not officially approved by the Puerto Rican government as a national flag until 1952. Norway has not legally challenged the shipping company's position that their flag is older than Puerto Rico's. The shipping company's flag is currently in use.",
