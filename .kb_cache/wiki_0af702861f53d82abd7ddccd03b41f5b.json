The Northern Wei dynasty was founded by the Tuoba clan of ethnic Xianbei who united northern China in the 4th century AD (Conquest dynasty). The Tuoba Xianbei rulers were themselves nomads from the northern steppes and became sinified as they ruled and settled in northern China. The Tuoba Xianbei took on the Chinese dynasty name \"Wei\", changed their own surname from \"Tuoba\" to \"Yuan\", and moved the capital from Pingcheng, modern-day Datong, Shanxi in the northern periphery of Imperial China, to Luoyang, south of the Yellow River, in the Central Plain, the traditional heartland of China. The emperors of the Northern Wei were known both by the sacred Chinese title, \"Son of Heaven\", and by \"Khagan\", the title of the leader of nomadic kingdoms. The Ballad of Mulan refers to the sovereign by both titles. The Northern Wei also adopted the governing institutions of Imperial China, and the office of shangshulang (\u5c1a\u66f8\u90ce) the Khagan offered Mulan is a ministerial position within the shangshusheng (\u5c1a\u66f8\u7701), the highest organ of executive power under the emperor.

Also around that time, a short straight-to-video film titled China Doll about an oppressed and miserable Chinese girl who is whisked away by a British Prince Charming to happiness in the West was in development.

Bacher further studied more than thirty-five film directors ranging from the silent era German Expressionism, British and American epics of the 1950s and 60s, and the Spaghetti Westerns for inspiration for composition, lighting, and staging that would establish settings that enhanced the characters.

He concluded that \"Adults will appreciate the depth of characterization while kids will love Mulan's sidekick, a colorful dragon named Mushu. Everyone will be entertained [by] the fast-moving plot and rich animation.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film \"a female empowerment story par excellence, as well as a G-rated picture that may have strong appeal for many adults.\" McCarthy further praised the voice cast and background design, but overall felt the film \"goes about halfway toward setting new boundaries for Disney\u2019s, and the industry's, animated features, but doesn't go far enough.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a B+ writing, \"Vividly animated, with a bursting palette that evokes both the wintry grandeur and decorative splendor of ancient China, Mulan is artful and satisfying in a slightly remote way.\"",

    "text": "Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune described the film as \"a big disappointment when compared with the studio's other recent films about a female hero searching for independence.\" He was further critical of Mulan's characterization in comparison to Ariel and Belle, and claimed the \"design of the film does not take advantage of the inspiration provided by classic Chinese artists, and the songs are not memorable.\" Similarly, Janet Maslin of The New York Times criticized the lack of detail in the background art and described it as \"the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films.\" Reviewing the film for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote \"Mulan has its accomplishments, but unlike the best of Disney's output, it comes off as more manufactured than magical.\" While he praised the title character, he highlighted that the \"by-now-standard hip patter (prepare for jokes about cross-dressing) is so tepid that not even five credited writers can revive it, and the songs by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel (with Lea Salonga and Donny Osmond singing for the leads) lack the spark that Zippel's lyrics brought to the underappreciated Hercules.\" Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine criticized the film as \"soulless\" in its portrayal of East Asian society.",

    "text": "Disney was keen to promote Mulan in China, hoping to replicate their success with the 1994 film The Lion King, which was one of the country's highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the Chinese government which had soured after the release of Kundun, a Disney-funded biography of the Dalai Lama that the Chinese government considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepted ten foreign films to be shown in China each year, Mulan's chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year's delay, the Chinese government did allow the film a limited Chinese release, but only after the Chinese New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market. Publications have reported that critical and audience reception in China was negative overall, who accused Disney of westernizing the tale. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. Chinese people also complained about Mulan's depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.",

Elizabeth Martin and Lauren Hynek's script treatment reportedly featured a white merchant who falls in love with Mulan, and is drawn into a central role in the country's conflict with the Huns.

    "text": "Although Mulan isn't royalty by either birth or marriage (her husband is merely a high-ranking military officer), she is part of the Disney Princess media franchise. Mulan was the last addition to the lineup until Princess Tiana from The Princess and the Frog was added in 2009, 11 years later. In the film Lilo & Stitch, Nani has a poster of Mulan in her room. Mulan is also present in the Disney and Square Enix video game series Kingdom Hearts. In the first Kingdom Hearts and in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, Mushu is a summonable character, and in Kingdom Hearts II, the movie is featured as a playable world named \"The Land of Dragons\", with the cast of the film reprising their roles (excluding Shan-Yu, now voiced by Corey Burton). In the first chapter of the game, the film's plot is changed to accommodate the game's characters (Sora, Donald and Goofy) and Mulan (both as herself and as \"Ping\") able to join the player's party as a skilled sword fighter, while the second chapter covers Organization XIII member Xigbar as a spy in black and Mulan's determination to stop him with Sora's help. The Land of Dragons is the first Disney-based world Sora must visit in his journey. Actress Jamie Chung plays a live-action version of Mulan in the second, third, and fifth seasons of the ABC television series Once Upon a Time. The video game Disney Magic Kingdoms includes some characters of the film and some attractions based on locations of the film as content to unlock for a limited time.",
