It was produced by Crawford Action Time (a collaboration of Crawford Productions and Action Time) in conjunction with Nine Network. The show saw a studio audience view a dramatised scenario, then complete rounds of interrogating the six suspects on stage in character and viewing further evidence through a pre-recorded criminal investigation. Players then deduced the solution to the murder case using a trio of computer-linked electronic dials (whodunnit, whatdunnit, and wheredunnit), and after the solution was revealed the first person who had locked-in this combination won a prize.",

Both the Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo television adaptations would be the brainchild of independent production company Action Time's founder and managing director Stephen Leahy. Leahy had previously spent 16 years at ITV franchisee Granada Television, where according to Head of Entertainment David Liddiment he \"built some of the finest quiz and game shows\" internally like The Krypton Factor (1977) and Busman's Holiday (1985) rather than the norm of \"pinch[ing] American shows\". In January 1988, Leahy left to become managing director of Action Time which at the time had just a few commissions and UK game show rights; over the next two years he oversaw a growth period resulting in ownership of rights to 103 games shows worldwide including 27 in the UK, and producing over 20 series for ITV by May 1990. In 1991, Birmingham Mail would describe Action Time as \"one of the big export successes in British TV\", thanks to Leahy having spotted a gap in the game show market in the 1980s and built an empire. The newspaper believed that Leahy's success since working on The Krypton Factor meant he was \"naturally first in the queue on the day Waddingtons released the [television] rights to Cluedo\".",

He was wary of this trend however; in a worldwide search for the next Wheel of Fortune he had come across Monopoly, the US television adaption of \"the world\u2019s greatest board game to television\", and experienced anguish at it being transformed into a \"terrible...mess\".

To Leahy, a Cluedo television game show offered an opportunity to further evolve the board game concept by offering a serialised format featuring clue-laden dramatic vignettes and having players work out the solution. He described the series as \"parlour entertainment\" in which there were no buzzers, scoreboards, or prizes like contemporary game shows, instead opting for gameplay based on teams competing to solve a mystery through deduction and elimination. Action Time head of production Malcolm Quiggan later assessed that Cluedo had proven itself as an exception to game shows not working on television because \"we\u2019re not watching players shaking dice and moving counters\".

While noting the importance of star vehicles to highlight talent and attract audiences, Leahy argued \"the shows are growing more intelligent and demanding hosts intelligent enough to host them\", revealing that after presenting Busman's Holiday to US executives they were \"gobsmacked\" it had a female host who was \"intelligent, articulate, and [not] a bimbo\".

Some staff voiced disagreement about Beijing's recent moves and the then-chairman John Slosar defended his staff saying in a press statement that \"We employ 27,000 people in Hong Kong ... we obviously do not imagine telling them what they have to think about certain subjects.\" Amid the pressure from Beijing, Cathay Pacific's CEO Rupert Hogg and chief customer and commercial officer Paul Loo both resigned on 16 August 2019; an article in CBS described Hogg's resignation as \"the highest-profile corporate casualty of official Chinese pressure on companies to support the ruling Communist Party's position.\" The actions by Beijing on the airline has in turn been criticised by current and former Cathay Pacific staff members and the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions.
