Theoretical therapies have also been proposed to use genetic engineering to attach synthetic chimeric antigen receptors to T-cells. These would bind to markers present in high levels in AML cells, which include CD123 and CD135. T-cells could also be modified to target normal CD45 markers, but this requires also modifying the CD-45 of T-cells as well so that they do not target themselves.
