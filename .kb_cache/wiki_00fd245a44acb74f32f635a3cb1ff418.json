Syrah first appeared as a wine grape in California in the 1970s, where it was planted by a group of viticulturists who called themselves \"Rhone rangers\". Although most plantings of the grape are in California, there are increasing amounts of it being grown in Washington state. Syrah makes up a significant percentage of wine produced in several Washington AVAs such as the Naches Heights AVA and the Walla Walla AVA. Syrah is increasingly being grown and produced in Oregon. Syrah is also found in small regions in Ohio.",

In exceptionally warm regions, such as parts of Napa, the wine is often blended with other Rh\u00f4ne varieties. Other appellations, primarily mountainous ones, tend to produce varietal-based wines that can stand on their own. Syrah was introduced into Washington state in 1986 by Red Willow Vineyard through their partnership with Woodinville, Washington-based Columbia Winery and Master of Wine David Lake. Expanding at a significant rate, it is used to produce single-varietial wines as well as being blended with grapes such as Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Cinsault and Viognier.",
