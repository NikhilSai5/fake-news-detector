In the storyline, Sarah turns to the internet in her bedroom as a way of meeting people. While visiting chatrooms, she is befriended by a 16-year-old boy who shares her interests and sends her a photo of himself. It turns out, however, that it is a man posing as a 16-year-old and when he persuades Sarah to meet him face-to-face, she finds herself in a very dangerous situation. A spokeswoman for Granada confirmed that the writers would be talking to the Home Office regarding the story. \"We have been in touch with the Home Office,\" she said. \"But it is very difficult at the moment with the election on and the government in purdah. We hope to work with it afterwards though.\" The spokeswoman said they hoped to highlight the issue of internet crime, given recent publicity by the Tonight with Trevor MacDonald show and TV presenter Carol Vorderman. The show should also prove a far more effective measure in tackling concern over internet chatrooms than either the melodramatic outpourings of celebrities or the authoritarian and legislative approach of the government. \"Sarah is hugely popular and a great role model for teenagers,\" the spokeswoman said. \"No matter how many politicians talk about the problem, they will never beat a peer in getting the message across. Plus, we know that many parents and kids watch the show side by side. Hopefully, we will spark some debate and then we would have done a good public service.\" It's hard to argue with that logic. However, while the show should do more to make kids aware of the potential dangers of chatrooms, we remain concerned that it could also be used to kick up a storm that will see unnecessary and draconian legislation pushed through on a wave of public worry.",

I still watch the show occasionally and get sucked in instantly\". O'Brien later reflected on her decision to leave, saying: \"I was very young when I started.

After I had Beau, it was then brought up again and I said, 'Oh yes, I'd love to'.

When I did the scenes with Jack [P Shepherd, who plays David] and Helen [Worth, who plays Gail] and everyone, it was really nice. Sarah has got a little bit older and wiser during her time away.

That's the Coronation Street I remember with Sarah-Lou in it. For her to be back in it now and me to be dating her is a bit crazy for me, but very enjoyable. Tina is so professional. She said she was nervous for the first scene and then it's like she's never been away. And I think that's because of the family that we are on Coronation Street, that I've been accepted into. It is just so easy to slip back into it.\" Asked whether Callum's interest in Sarah-Lou is really genuine, he replied: \"Half and half. I mean there's the element that it's David's sister and that's going to help Callum's way on the street, but she's very feisty and he needs someone to match him, and I think Sarah-Lou is the girl to do that.\" Speaking of the storyline in an interview O'Brien said: \"I think it will be interesting to see a more daring side to Sarah. Because she had a baby quite young, she had to be more responsible back then. It's really nice to be working with Sean Ward. I'm sure people think it's funny that the second she walks in, she hooks up with the guy who will cause most problems with the family. \"To begin with she isn't interested in Callum at all. It's only because David really gives her a hard time that it almost pushes her towards Callum. She even says, 'Don't tell me what to do or else I will do the opposite' because David is like 'You stay away'.

In her head she thinks they could play happy families \u2013 she's ten steps ahead! She's really torn. I don't think Sarah actually harbours bad feelings towards her brother anymore so it's difficult. She does say to Callum at one point that he's won and her brother has lost, so she does show Callum support. But I think she's trying to be neutral for David too.\" Sarah and Callum later break up and Sarah is furious to discover that Bethany has been delivering drugs on Callum's behalf.

At that point, the complete history of Squall's character was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima.

Following the failed mission in Centra, Kiros is separated from Laguna and Ward. He heals quickly and decides to leave the Galbadian army, but soon finds that life without Laguna lacks excitement. His subsequent search for Laguna brings him to Winhill after nearly a year. When Laguna is forced to leave Winhill to find Ellone, Kiros accompanies him, helping him earn money as an amateur actor to fund the expedition. Kiros remains by Laguna's side throughout his adventures in Esthar, earning a place as Laguna's advisor when he becomes president. Like Ward, Kiros' interactions with Laguna are based on the staff's interactions during development.",

Her motives are unknown, but SeeD dispatches Squall to assassinate her. The mission fails after an unknown entity possesses Rinoa and Edea sends a bolt of ice through Squall's chest. It is later revealed that Edea is the wife of Headmaster Cid, and was known as \"Matron\" to Squall and the kids that lived at the orphanage. It is also revealed that Edea was not acting of her own will, but was possessed by a sorceress from the future named Ultimecia.

Game Revolution cited similar praise, agreeing that the change \"really makes the graphics impressive\". Jeff Lundigran of IGN commented that the \"low-polygon characters of Final Fantasy VII are gone, replaced with sometimes surprisingly realistic high-polygon models that only look better the closer they get\".

With Squall, he felt that \"FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill\". However, GameSpot felt that Final Fantasy VIII shifts the story from the \"epic\" concepts of VII to the \"personal\", in that \"the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny\". A later editorial by IGN's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment, appreciating that Squall and Rinoa's single kiss during the finale serves \"one of the player's main rewards for hours of dedication\". Although the reviewer at Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he wrote that \"it's only later in the game, once you are really attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced\".",
