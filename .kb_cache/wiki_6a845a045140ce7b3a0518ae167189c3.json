Maduro's Foreign Minister Arreaza said in 2019 that economic sanctions had cost the Venezuelan economy US$30 billion; a 2020 WOLA report agreed with that figure. Reporting on Arreaza's statement, the Associated Press said that Maduro was blocking aid on the premise that \"Venezuelans are not beggars\". After the 2020 U.S. sanctions on Luis Parra, Arreaza stated that the U.S. sanctions were undermining democratic institutions.",

The Wall Street Journal said in January 2019 that economists place the blame for Venezuela's economy shrinking by half on policies of the Maduro administration, \"including widespread nationalizations, out-of-control spending that sparked inflation, price controls that led to shortages, and widespread graft and mismanagement\".",

Some economists, scholars and non-governmental organizations state that the sanctions worsened the economic crisis, and limited income sources and public spending, considering that most of Venezuela's food and medicine is imported. In 2021, the US Government Accountability Office concluded that sanctions \"likely contributed to Venezuela's economic decline\". The report said that as a result of sanctions, Venezuela is selling less oil, at a higher cost and a lower price. In 2023, Al Jazeera wrote that the sanctions had affected citizens. In 2024, the Financial Times described the sanctions as \"crippling\".",

Two United Nations special rapporteurs had earlier criticized the U.S. sanctions as \"economic warfare\", stating that their use to \"overthrow an elected government is in violation of all norms of international law\". In early 2021, Alena Douhan, UN special rapporteur, visited Venezuela; 66 Venezuelan NGOs asked her to consider the harmful impact of sanctions in the context of years of repression, corruption and economic mismanagement. In her preliminary report, Douhan said that the economic pressure against Venezuela worsened the crisis, but that Venezuela's economic decline \"began in 2014 with the fall in oil prices\" and that \"mismanagement and corruption had also contributed\". She asked the U.S., U.K. and Portugal to release an estimated $6 billion in frozen Venezuelan foreign assets. The government welcomed the report, while the opposition accused her of \"playing into the hands of the regime\". Douhan's report was criticized, and some NGOs manifested on social media with the hashtag \"#Lacrisisfueprimero\" (The crisis came first).",

Swiss hedge fund Mangart Capital estimated that the debt held by US interests decreased from 75% in 2017 to between 35% and 40% in 2023. Sabatini argued that as a result the new bondholders could prevent a democratic transition of the country and prevent it from entering global capital exchanges in the future.",

The Independent wrote that similar concerns had been raised earlier by UN representatives. The report's findings and methodology were described as invalid and disputed by other economists, La Patilla, the US State department, and the Brookings Institution, who stated that most of the decline pre-dated the sanctions and that the methodology was flawed or speculative. Opposition-aligned academic and Guaido appointee Ricardo Hausmann and Frank Muci published a rebuttal in Americas Quarterly, stating that the analysis took Colombia as a counterfactual for Venezuela, when Colombia and Venezuela are \"radically different in other dimensions\". They argued that oil production trends between the two nations were different in the decade before sanctions and that a month after the 2017 sanctions, Maduro replaced the PDVSA president with an inexperienced military general who restructured the oil entity, worsening its performance.",
