Unless a feast day occurs on a Wednesday, the Orthodox also abstain from fish, from using oil in their cooking and from alcoholic beverages (there is some debate over whether abstention from oil involves all cooking oil or only olive oil). For the Orthodox, Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year commemorate the betrayal of Jesus (Wednesday) and the Crucifixion of Christ (Friday). There are hymns in the Octoekhos which reflect this liturgically.  These include special Theotokia (hymns to the Mother of God) called Stavrotheotokia ('Cross-Theotokia').

    "text": "The creative team sought a Latina to play the role of Wednesday Addams to align with character Gomez Addams's heritage, an aspect of the character that was already worked into the series' script. In May 2021, Jenna Ortega, who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, was cast in the role. Millar stated that, upon their first Zoom call together, the creative team knew that \"nobody else on this planet\" was better suited to portray the character. Ortega said that she was initially hesitant about joining the project due to her past work in teen-oriented Disney Channel shows and her plans to prioritize film over television work, but decided to join in after meeting Burton through Zoom. In the beginning of August of that year, Luis Guzm\u00e1n was cast to guest-star as Gomez Addams, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was cast as Morticia Addams in an undisclosed capacity. Later that month, Thora Birch, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Georgie Farmer, Moosa Mostafa, Emma Myers, Naomi J. Ogawa, Joy Sunday, and Percy Hynes White were announced to be cast as series regulars. Myers initially auditioned for the titular role before she was cast as Wednesday's roommate Enid Sinclair.",

In March 2022, it was announced that Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday Addams in the film The Addams Family and its sequel Addams Family Values (1993), was cast as a series regular, replacing Birch in a similar role. Commenting on her casting, Ricci stated, \"I was really flattered to be asked and to be asked by Tim [Burton]\", with whom she had previously collaborated on Sleepy Hollow (1999). Ricci was almost unable to accept the role due to possible scheduling conflicts with Showtime series Yellowjackets. In October, a trailer revealed Fred Armisen to be portraying Uncle Fester and Ricci's role was confirmed as Marilyn Thornhill.",

To prepare for her role, Ortega learned to play cello and took canoeing, fencing, archery and German lessons. According to actress Joy Sunday, the canoeing lessons were especially strenuous, involving the entire cast and some dozen stuntmen racing each other for an hour daily, with days starting as early as 5:30 am. Ortega avoided talking to Ricci about playing the character during filming to achieve her own unique rendition of the role. She choreographed her dance to the Cramps' \"Goo Goo Muck\" herself, taking inspiration from Siouxsie Sioux, Bob Fosse and goth dance club footage from the 1980s. Ortega sought to make Wednesday's characterization consistent, down to changing lines that she felt were unfitting of the character and with more depth. She stated \"you can't lead a story and have no emotional arc because then it's boring and nobody likes you.\" Scenes featuring Thing, played by Romanian magician Victor Dorobantu, were achieved using a mixture of practical and special effects; Dorobantu wore a blue chroma-key bodysuit that would be edited out in post-production, leaving only his hand exposed. To create the illusion of a severed hand, a prosthetic stump was applied to Dorobantu's hand.",
