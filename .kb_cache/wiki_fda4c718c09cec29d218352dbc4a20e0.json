The date, 11 November (11/11), was chosen because the numeral 1 resembles a bare stick (Chinese: \u5149\u68cd; pinyin: gu\u0101ngg\u00f9n), Chinese Internet slang for an unmarried man. The four \"1\"s also refer to the demographic group of single people. Ironically, the holiday has become a popular date on which to celebrate relationships: more than 4,000 couples got married in Beijing on this date in 2011, far greater than the daily average of 700 marriages.",
