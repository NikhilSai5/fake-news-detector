Hamas, a Palestinian nationalist Islamist political and militant group, won the majority of seats in the Palestinian legislative election in January 2006. Hamas had been responsible up to that time for dozens of suicide bombings within Israeli territory, and its charter (until 2017) called for murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel. Israel frequently instated blockades on imports of goods to Gaza in 2006, including before and during the election; while a blockade on exports cut off Gaza's existing industries (textiles, furniture, greenhouse berry farming) from foreign markets.
