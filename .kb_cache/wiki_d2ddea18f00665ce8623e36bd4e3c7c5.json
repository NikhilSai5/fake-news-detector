IGN's Robert Anderson praised the atmosphere of the episode, considering it \"among the best 'Doctor-lite' episodes ever\", despite commenting that some plot threads do not resolve in a satisfactory manner. Louise Griffin of Radio Times opined that the \"unanswered questions\" contributed \"to the riddle of the story\" and the execution was good, adding that she believed there was a limit for audiences, but the episode did not cross it. Digital Spy's Rebecca Cook thought the episode was \"frustratingly close to being faultless\", criticising the Gwilliam plot as well as its execution in conjunction with the rest of the episode. Cook compared it to the series four episode \"Turn Left\" (2008), and praised the decision to exclude the Doctor saying it gave Gibson room to breathe. She also praised the directing of Dylan Holmes Williams. Jennifer Zhan of Vulture gave a more mixed review, giving the episode three out of five, feeling that various questions were left unanswered, and even calls Ruby not initially helping Marti to be contrasting with her established character. Adi Tantimedh from Bleeding Cool gave the episode a 10/10, saying that it \"perfectly encapsulates the absurdity and horror of the modern world through the lens of a multi-colored puppet nightmare of epic proportions\". Julie River of Out Front praised Gibson's performance, but criticised the \"frustrating\" mystery and the unanswered questions.",
