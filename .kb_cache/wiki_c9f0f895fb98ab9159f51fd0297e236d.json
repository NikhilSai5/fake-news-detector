    "text": "First released in Italy on 14 February 1963, 8\u00bd received widespread acclaim, with reviewers hailing Fellini as \"a genius possessed of a magic touch, a prodigious style\". Italian novelist and critic Alberto Moravia described the film's protagonist, Guido Anselmi, as \"obsessed by eroticism, a sadist, a masochist, a self-mythologizer, an adulterer, a clown, a liar and a cheat. He's afraid of life and wants to return to his mother's womb ... In some respects, he resembles Leopold Bloom, the hero of James Joyce's Ulysses, and we have the impression that Fellini has read and contemplated this book. The film is introverted, a sort of private monologue interspersed with glimpses of reality .... Fellini's dreams are always surprising and, in a figurative sense, original, but his memories are pervaded by a deeper, more delicate sentiment. This is why the two episodes concerning the hero's childhood at the old country house in Romagna and his meeting with the woman on the beach in Rimini are the best of the film, and among the best of all Fellini's works to date\".",

    "text": "Reviewing for Corriere della Sera, Giovanni Grazzini underlined that \"the beauty of the film lies in its 'confusion'... a mixture of error and truth, reality and dream, stylistic and human values, and in the complete harmony between Fellini's cinematographic language and Guido's rambling imagination. It is impossible to distinguish Fellini from his fictional director and so Fellini's faults coincide with Guido's spiritual doubts. The osmosis between art and life is amazing. It will be difficult to repeat this achievement. Fellini's genius shines in everything here, as it has rarely shone in the movies. There isn't a set, a character or a situation that doesn't have a precise meaning on the great stage that is 8\u00bd\". Mario Verdone of Bianco e Nero insisted the film was \"like a brilliant improvisation ... The film became the most difficult feat the director ever tried to pull off. It is like a series of acrobats [sic] that a tightrope walker tries to execute high above the crowd, ... always on the verge of falling and being smashed on the ground. But at just the right moment, the acrobat knows how to perform the right somersault: with a push he straightens up, saves himself and wins\".",

French film director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut wrote: \"Fellini's film is complete, simple, beautiful, honest, like the one Guido wants to make in 8\u00bd\". Premier Plan critics Andr\u00e9 Bouissy and Raymond Borde argued that the film \"has the importance, magnitude, and technical mastery of Citizen Kane. It has aged twenty years of the avant-garde in one fell swoop because it both integrates and surpasses all the discoveries of experimental cinema\". Pierre Kast of Les Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma explained that \"my admiration for Fellini is not without limits. For instance, I did not enjoy La Strada but I did I Vitelloni. But I think we must all admit that 8\u00bd, leaving aside for the moment all prejudice and reserve, is prodigious. Fantastic liberality, a total absence of precaution and hypocrisy, absolute dispassionate sincerity, artistic and financial courage these are the characteristics of this incredible undertaking\".

Levine, who had bought the rights sight unseen, the film was screened at the Festival Theatre in New York City in the presence of Fellini and Marcello Mastroianni. The acclaim was unanimous with the exception of reviews by Judith Crist, Pauline Kael, and John Simon. Crist \"didn't think the film touched the heart or moved the spirit\". Kael derided the film as a \"structural disaster\" while Simon considered it \"a disheartening fiasco\". Newsweek defended the film as \"beyond doubt, a work of art of the first magnitude\". Bosley Crowther praised it in The New York Times as \"a piece of entertainment that will really make you sit up straight and think, a movie endowed with the challenge of a fascinating intellectual game ... If Mr. Fellini has not produced another masterpiece \u2013 another all-powerful exposure of Italy's ironic sweet life \u2013 he has made a stimulating contemplation of what might be called, with equal irony, a sweet guy\". Archer Winsten of the New York Post interpreted the film as \"a kind of review and summary of Fellini's picture-making\" but doubted that it would appeal as directly to the American public as La Dolce Vita had three years earlier: \"This is a subtler, more imaginative, less sensational piece of work. There will be more people here who consider it confused and confusing. And when they do understand what it is about \u2013 the simultaneous creation of a work of art, a philosophy of living together in happiness, and the imposition of each upon the other, they will not be as pleased as if they had attended the exposition of an international scandal\". Audiences, however, loved it to such an extent that a company attempted to obtain the rights to mass-produce Guido Anselmi's black director's hat.",

    "text": "Fellini biographer Hollis Alpert noted that in the months following its release, critical commentary on 8\u00bd proliferated as the film \"became an intellectual cud to chew on\". Philosopher and social critic Dwight Macdonald, for example, insisted it was \"the most brilliant, varied, and entertaining movie since Citizen Kane\". In 1987, a group of thirty European intellectuals and filmmakers voted Otto e mezzo the most important European film ever made. In 1993, Chicago Sun-Times film reviewer Roger Ebert wrote that \"despite the efforts of several other filmmakers to make their own versions of the same story, it remains the definitive film about director's block\". 8\u00bd was voted the best foreign (i.e. non-Swedish) sound film with 21 votes in a 1964 poll of 50 Swedish film professionals organized by Swedish film magazine Chaplin. The Village Voice ranked the film at number 112 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. Entertainment Weekly voted it at No. 36 on their list of 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. In 2000, Ebert added it to his \"Great Movies\" list, calling it \"the best film ever made about filmmaking\", concluding \"I have seen 8\u00bd over and over again, and my appreciation only deepens. It does what is almost impossible: Fellini is a magician who discusses, reveals, explains and deconstructs his tricks, while still fooling us with them. He claims he doesn't know what he wants or how to achieve it, and the film proves he knows exactly, and rejoices in his knowledge.\" 8\u00bd is a fixture on the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound critics' and directors' polls of the top 10 films ever made. The film ranked 4th and 5th on critics' poll in 1972 and 1982 respectively. It ranked 2nd on the magazine's 1992 and 2002 Directors' Top Ten Poll and 8th on the 2002 Critics' Top Ten Poll. It was slightly lower in the 2012 directors' poll, 4th and 10th on the 2012 critics' poll. The film was included in Time's All-Time 100 best movies list in 2005. The film was voted at No. 46 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma in 2008. In 2010, the film was ranked #62 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\". It was also ranked number 1 when the Museum of Cinematography in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a asked 279 Polish film professionals (filmmakers, critics, and professors) in 2015 to vote for the best films.",

In conversation with the Criterion Collection, he named it one of his favorites: What would Fellini do after La dolce vita? We all wondered. How would he top himself? Would he even want to top himself? Would he shift gears? Finally, he did something that no one could have anticipated at the time. He took his own artistic and life situation\u2014that of a filmmaker who had eight and a half films to his name (episodes for two omnibus films and a shared credit with Alberto Lattuada on Variety Lights counted for him as one and a half films, plus seven), achieved international renown with his last feature and felt enormous pressure when the time came for a follow-up\u2014and he built a movie around it. 8\u00bd has always been a touchstone for me, in so many ways\u2014the freedom, the sense of invention, the underlying rigor and the deep core of longing, the bewitching, physical pull of the camera movements and the compositions...But it also offers an uncanny portrait of being the artist of the moment, trying to tune out all the pressure and the criticism and the adulation and the requests and the advice, and find the space and the calm to simply listen to oneself. The picture has inspired many movies over the years (including Alex in Wonderland, Stardust Memories, and All That Jazz), and we\u2019ve seen the dilemma of Guido, the hero played by Marcello Mastroianni, repeated many times over in reality\u2014look at the life of Bob Dylan during the period we covered in No Direction Home, to take just one example.
