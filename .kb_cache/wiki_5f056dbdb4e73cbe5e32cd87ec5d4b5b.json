Tony Banks added an ominous chord progression, establishing the song's dark tone and inspiring its lyrics, which depict a drug addict\u2019s struggle to contact their dealer for another fix. The lyrics explore themes of addiction (\"a load on your back that you can't see,\" \"shake it loose\"), desperation (\"I've got to get it to you,\" \"I keep calling but you're never home\"), and eventual anguish (\"now I'm in too deep,\" \"please get me out of here!\") . Collins intensified the emotional climax with dramatic drum fills featuring his signature gated reverb. The album version extends to nearly nine minutes, including a refrain and keyboard solo, which were cut from the single and radio edit.",
