    "text": "The quickstep is a light-hearted dance of the standard ballroom dances. The movement of the dance is fast and powerfully flowing and sprinkled with syncopations. The upbeat melodies that quickstep is danced to make it suitable for both formal and informal events. Its origins are in combination of slow foxtrot combined with the Charleston, a dance which was one of the precursors to what today is called swing dancing.",

    "text": "The quickstep evolved in the 1920s from a combination of the foxtrot, Charleston, shag, peabody, and one-step. The dance is English in origin and was standardized in 1927. While it evolved from the foxtrot, the quickstep now is quite separate. Unlike the modern foxtrot, the leader often closes his feet, and syncopated steps are regular occurrences (as was the case in early foxtrot). Three characteristic dance figures of the quickstep are the chass\u00e9s, where the feet are brought together, the quarter turns, and the lock step.p126",

The tempo of quickstep dance is rather brisk, as it was developed to ragtime era jazz music, which is fast-paced when compared to other dance music.",

While in older times quickstep patterns were counted with \"quick\" (one beat) and \"slow\" (two beats) steps, many advanced patterns today are cued with split beats, such as \"quick-and-quick-and-quick, quick, slow\", with there being further steps on the 'and's.",
