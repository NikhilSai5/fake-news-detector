Archeological data also suggests the existence of market districts in ancient Mesopotamia. Markets centers must have existed in Egypt to conduct international trade, but no archeological evidence for them has been found. In Achaemenid Persia (550\u2013330 BCE), documents indicate that crafts were sold in markets close to Persepolis. A network of bazaars had sprung up alongside ancient caravan trade routes. Bazaars located along these trade routes formed networks, linking major cities with each other and in which goods, culture, people and information could be exchanged. Sources from around the same era also indicate that ancient Greeks regulated trade in areas at the center of their cities around stoa buildings.

However, his brothers (James and Joseph Harper) believed that they were already too busy with their other publications (Harper's Monthly and Harper's Weekly) and that they would not be able to launch a new publication. Fletcher then decided to publish the magazine himself however upon hearing this the brothers changed their minds and decided to publish it together.The publication debuted on November 2, 1867, and was published by Harper & Brothers, based in New York City and edited by Mary Louise Booth. The magazine was published in a folio tabloid-size format and published weekly, with the subtitle of \"A Repository of Fashion, Pleasure, and Instruction.\" During this time Harper's Bazar was able to stay ahead of other American publications like Godey's Lady's Book and Peterson's, which had to copy their illustrations from French magazines and re-engrave the printing plates of the latest fashions; however, due to the partnership with Der Bazar, the magazine would be sent the electrotypes of the original printing plates which lead to Harper's Bazar publishing the latest illustrations at the same time as the European journals which was months ahead of the other American publications.
