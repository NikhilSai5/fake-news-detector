    "text": "There is a sizable community of the Indian diaspora and people of Indian descent in Uganda. In 2003, there were an estimated 15,000 people of Asian descent (mostly Indians and Pakistanis) living in Uganda. Members of this community are known as Indian-Ugandans, Indo-Ugandans, and Indo-Pakistani Ugandans. At its peak in the 1960s, the community's population stood at between 80,000 to 100,000 people. However, in 1972, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin issued an order to expel all South Asians from the country amidst a backdrop of anti-Indian sentiment and Black supremacy. In response to the exodus, India, the United Kingdom, and several other countries severed diplomatic ties with Uganda.",

    "text": "After the 1979 Tanzanian invasion of Uganda overthrew Idi Amin and exiled him to Libya, many Indians gradually returned to Uganda over the course of the 1980s and 1990s. This return was significantly encouraged by Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who helped depose Amin and actively invited expelled Asians to reclaim their properties and invest in Uganda's economy. Museveni\u2019s pro-business policies and public recognition of the Indian community\u2019s contribution to national development created a more favourable environment for their reintegration.",

The Imperial British East Africa Company awarded Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee, an agent based in Karachi, with the contract to supply the required labour force. Jeevanjee recruited his workforce from the Punjab region of British India. The first group to arrive had a total of 350 men, and over a six-year period, a total of 31,895 men worked on the project. Some died, others returned to India after the end of their contracts, and others chose to stay. The population was later bolstered by Gujarati traders called \"passenger Indians\", both Hindu and Muslim free migrants who came to serve the economic needs of the indentured labourers and to capitalize on the economic opportunities.",

These resentments came to a crisis when Idi Amin ousted Milton Obote by military coup d'\u00e9tat in 1971. The following year, Amin ordered the expulsion of Indians from Uganda. As a result, many Indians migrated to the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and elsewhere and began rebuilding their lives. After Amin's death, however, more Indians who were born in Uganda started migrating back.",
