The idea of relocating some of the population of Gardi Sugdub to a new settlement on the mainland was first raised by Guna elders in 2008. By 2010, there were 30 families on the island, or around 150 people, interested in relocation, and an area of land on the mainland was cleared to make room for a new settlement. In 2011, the number of families interested in relocation had increased to 65, who formed the La Barriada Committee and entered talks with the Panamanian government's Ministry of Housing and Territorial Planning; they abandoned plans to use traditional construction methods in favour of standard modern construction practices for cost reasons.",
