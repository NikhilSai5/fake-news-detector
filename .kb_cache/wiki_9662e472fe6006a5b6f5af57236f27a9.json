They consider the Quran, the foundational religious text of Islam, to be the verbatim word of the God of Abraham (or Allah) as it was revealed to Muhammad, the last Islamic prophet. Alongside the Quran, Muslims also believe in previous revelations, such as the Tawrat (Torah), the Zabur (Psalms), and the Injeel (Gospel). These earlier revelations are associated with Judaism and Christianity, which are regarded by Muslims as earlier versions of Islam. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices attributed to Muhammad (sunnah) as recorded in traditional accounts (hadith).",

This made the word more closely match the Arabic triliteral \u1e93-l-m (\u0638-\u0644-\u0645), which has negative meanings and includes the Arabic word for \"the oppressor\". In the United States, the Associated Press instructed news outlets to switch to the spelling \"Muslim\" in 1991, making it the most common spelling thereafter. The last major newspaper in the United Kingdom to use the spelling \"Moslem\" was the Daily Mail, which switched to \"Muslim\" in 2004.",
