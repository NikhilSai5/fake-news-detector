It is located in Carabobo State, about 210 km west of Caracas. As of 2011, the city had a population of around 182,400. The city is home to the largest and busiest port in the country and is thus a vital cog in the country's vast oil industry. The word 'cabello' translates to 'hair'. The Spanish took to saying that the sea was so calm there that a ship could be moored to the dock with a single hair.",

British Commodore Charles Knowles, in command of the 70-gun HMS Suffolk, received orders in 1743 to carry out attacks Puerto Cabello and La Guaira. Governor Gabriel de Zuluaga, well informed of the plans, recruited extra defenders and acquired gunpowder from the Dutch. Consequently, when Knowle's squadron attacked La Guaira on 18 February 1743, they were beaten off by the defenders. Knowles withdrew his squadron and refitted at Cura\u00e7ao before attempting an assault on Puerto Cabello on April 15, and again on April 24, but both assaults were beaten off as well. Knowles called off the expedition and returned to Jamaica.",

The frigate Santa Cecilia (former HMS Hermione), under the command of Captain Don Ram\u00f3n de Chalas, sat in Puerto Cabello until Captain Edward Hamilton, aboard HMS Surprise, cut her out of the harbour on October 25, 1799. The Spanish casualties included 120 dead; the British took 231 Spaniards prisoner, while another 15 jumped or fell overboard. Eleven of Hamilton's men were injured, four seriously, but none was killed. Hamilton himself was severely wounded.",
