In Prague and other cities throughout the republic, Czechs and Slovaks greeted Warsaw Pact soldiers with arguments and reproaches. Vladimir Bogdanovich Rezun, then a junior officer who led a Soviet Tank column during the invasion, was given absurd information from his commanders about how the people of Czechoslovakia would welcome them as their \"Liberators\", and were instead attacked by angry crowds of people who threw stones, eggs, tomatoes, and apples upon crossing into Slovakia. Every form of assistance, including the provision of food and water, was denied to the invaders. In an opposite case of subterfuge, Rezun recalled how local townspeople quietly opened the gates of the Czech breweries and spirit factories for the enlisted Soviet soldiers, making entire units inebriated and causing significant disruptions to the fury of the Soviet commanders. Signs, placards, and graffiti drawn on walls and pavements denounced the invaders, the Soviet leaders, and suspected collaborationists. Pictures of Dub\u010dek and Svoboda appeared in the streets. Citizens gave wrong directions to soldiers and even removed street signs (except for those giving the direction back to Moscow). Against organizers, perpetrators, and European leaders who pushed for the invasions, Czechoslovakians demonstrated their anger, expressed through art, songs, and media. One of the most famous examples can be seen in the case of Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader who heavily pushed for the invasion. He ordered the East German military to prepare two NVA divisions, comprising over 16,000 troops, for the invasion, but the Soviet Union did not allow him to deploy them, for fear of reawakening memories of the 1939 German invasion. Despite the NVA troops being halted, anger and disdain for collaborators and advocates such as Ulbricht remained strong. One poster stated, \u201cGerman soldiers go home and liquidate Ulbricht, who is a new Hitler! Your people do not agree with your actions!\u201d",
