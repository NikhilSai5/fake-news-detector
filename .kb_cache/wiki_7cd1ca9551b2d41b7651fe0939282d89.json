She explained that she requested all of the remaining embryos be transferred into her uterus at one time. A woman her age would normally have a maximum of three embryos transferred. Suleman says that part of her reasoning for attempting a seventh pregnancy was so that the frozen embryos would not be destroyed. Beginning with the first egg retrieval in 2000, Suleman's extra embryos had been frozen and stored with Dr. Kamrava. Despite this, fresh cycles of hormone therapy and egg retrieval were performed for each of Suleman's pregnancies, instead of using the frozen embryos already available. In June 2011, during an investigation by the Medical Board of California, it was found that Kamrava had transferred twelve embryos, which the board found to be an \"extreme\" departure from standard of care. After reviewing Suleman's case, in combination with three other cases, the Medical Board of California voted to revoke Kamrava's medical license, effective July 1, 2011.",

Suleman claimed to be able to independently support her children, saying she was planning to return to school to complete a master's degree in counseling.

By April 14, 2009, all of the children were home with their mother and grandmother. The octuplets celebrated their first birthday on January 26, 2010. Suleman told People magazine, \"I don't get much sleep, but I'm used to that. Once one of the kids gets up, they all get up. Some nights I don't sleep at all or as little as half an hour. On the good nights, I may get up to two full hours. The longest I've gone without sleeping is 72 hours. It's hard, but I'm continuing to move forward with my life and trying to be the best mother I can be.\"",
