    "text": "The island community in the film represents a post-progressive return to regressivism, where society shifts away from forward-looking ideals and instead toward nostalgic myths rooted in a misremembered past. The society's norms echo those of pre-1960s Britain; authoritarian parenting and 1950s-style conformity illustrate what Garland sees as a collective cultural amnesia where people forget why certain values were previously abandoned. A montage blending authentic British wartime footage with scenes from the film Henry V (1944) reflects the filmmakers\u2019 intention to depict how the isolated community reconstructs a cultural mythology from fragmented and partially remembered aspects of Britain\u2019s past. The sequence illustrates how narratives such as the Battle of Agincourt or the Blitz become distorted through transmission, evolving into instinctive half-truths rather than historically accurate accounts.",

In July of the same year, Danny Boyle said that the story for a third instalment had been mapped out. By October 2010, Alex Garland stated that due to differences involving the film rights, the project had been delayed. In January 2011, Boyle stated that he believed the project would be realised, confirming further developments for the story. By April 2013, however, the filmmaker expressed uncertainty as to whether the movie would be made. In January 2015, Garland addressed the project's status, confirming that while it had fallen into development hell there were serious discussions going on behind the scenes to produce the project. Reiterating that development was progressing, he stated that the script he was working on was tentatively titled 28 Months Later. In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that he and Garland had been working on the third instalment. In March 2020, Imogen Poots expressed interest in reprising her role from 28 Weeks Later, followed by Cillian Murphy in May 2021.",

Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, and Peter Rice will serve as producers. In February of the same year, Murphy discussed his potential involvement with the project; that same month, it was reported that the rights to the first film had reverted to Macdonald from Searchlight Pictures. He promptly sold the first film's distribution rights to Sony Pictures, as well as rights to future sequels. In March 2024, Garland confirmed that he is writing a trilogy of sequel films. The following month, Garland said the 1969 film Kes was a major influence. Murphy was revealed as an executive producer later that month. The film was produced by Columbia Pictures, and DNA Films, with funding support from TSG Entertainment.",

The film was primarily shot using an iPhone 15 Pro Max, in addition to action cameras, drones, and other digital and film cameras. The use of small digital cameras harks back to filming the original 28 Days Later using the Canon XL-1 digital camcorder, which was manoeuvrable enough to film the deserted locales within the time limits allowed by officials. The film was shot in a 2.76:1 aspect ratio, reminiscent of productions using Ultra Panavision 70, which was chosen to emphasise the unpredictability of the infected and to heighten tension by compelling viewers to \"keep scanning\" the wide frame.",

Some shots employed a bullet time effect, created using a custom-built circular rig equipped with eight to twenty iPhone cameras. This setup also allowed scenes to be filmed from multiple angles simultaneously, giving director Danny Boyle greater flexibility during editing. Boyle explained that using iPhones allowed the crew to film with minimal equipment, providing easier access to the rural landscapes of Northumberland while minimising environmental impact and helping to preserve the area's natural appearance. The iPhone's default camera software posed some challenges for filming because its automatic focus tended to prioritise the brightest or most prominent object in the frame rather than the intended point of dramatic focus, requiring manual overrides to achieve the desired cinematic effect.",
