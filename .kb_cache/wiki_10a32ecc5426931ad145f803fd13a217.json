Some political analysts considered Biden's performance in the October 11 vice-presidential debate one of the best of his career and a key factor in Obama's rebound in the polls and eventual victory. The debate also became memorable for the popularization of Biden's use of the phrase \"a bunch of malarkey\" in response to an attack by Ryan on the administration's response to the attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi in September. Biden reused the phrase during his 2020 presidential campaign. On November 6, Obama and Biden were reelected.",

On December 1, 2024, he issued a \"full and unconditional\" pardon to Hunter Biden that covered all federal offenses between 2014 and December 1, 2024. The pardon's sweeping extent was \"unprecedented\". According to Reason magazine, Hunter Biden's pardon was even more far-reaching than Richard Nixon's or other \"controversial\" pardons:The Hunter pardon is far more comprehensive...in that it covered not just his convictions for drug-related activities and tax fraud, but any other criminal behavior since 2014\u2014the year that Hunter joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. It has been alleged that Hunter's job was essentially to trade on the family name and sell his access to dad. This may not have been illegal, but it does mean that the pardon is clearly designed to offer preemptive protection not just to Hunter, but to Joe Biden himself. These features make the pardon unprecedented, though perfectly in line with the president's executive powers.Hunter had been convicted on charges related to tax and gun offenses, after which Joe made numerous promises not to pardon him. He and his staff continued to say that Hunter would not be pardoned as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option remained on the table even as Biden said otherwise. Biden and his family finalized the decision to pardon Hunter without consulting senior staff. In a statement announcing the pardon, Biden said he believed his son was \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\", blaming \"political pressure\" for the collapse of a plea bargain. The plea bargain actually fell apart after the presiding judge asked about its unusual construction. Biden's pardon came amid incoming December sentencing dates for Hunter for his convictions and concerns about the succeeding Trump administration potentially targeting political rivals for prosecution. Biden said, \"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\"",
