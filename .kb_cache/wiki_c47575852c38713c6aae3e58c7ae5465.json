    "text": "Thirty years have passed since Dr. Samuel \"Sam\" Beckett vanished into the Quantum Leap accelerator. The United States Department of Defense has restarted the Quantum Leap project with a new team trying to recreate the accelerator and retrieve Beckett from the past. For reasons unknown, Dr. Ben Song, the new project's lead physicist, has uploaded new program code to Ziggy, the project's supercomputer and used the upgraded accelerator to leap back in time without informing anyone on the team as to why. He becomes stuck in the past just as Beckett did, living the lives of other people and changing history for the better. However, his leaps appear to have a trajectory to take him to a specific point in spacetime. Project employee Addison Augustine, who is Ben's fianc\u00e9e, acts as his liaison with the project, appearing to him as a hologram that only he can see and hear, just as the previous project's observer Al Calavicci did for Beckett.",
