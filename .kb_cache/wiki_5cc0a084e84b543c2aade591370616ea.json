At the beginning they were producing parts for the now defunct Argentinian arms manufacturer Ballester\u2013Molina. Their first handgun was a modified version of a Ballester model which they called \"Luan\", combining the first two letters of the last names of the 2 designers of the pistol, Luce and Antonovich. The gun did not have much commercial success and very few of them were produced; nowadays they are quite rare collector's items.",

In 1960 the name \"Bersa\" was introduced, taken from the initial letters of the founders' first names. Many more successful models in increasingly more powerful calibers were produced in the following years, making Bersa a well-known and respected name in the firearms world. In 1989 the first full-size combat pistol was introduced, the Model 90, chambered for the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge.",
